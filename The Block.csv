Suspicious link offers Pepe holders a chance to mint one of 10,000 NFTs but references another collection that already minted at a total supply of 6,969.
“This deceptive practice is a common tactic employed by scammers, luring unsuspecting buyers into fraudulent transactions,” said The Block Research Analyst Brad Kay.

Seemingly trying to take advantage of the frothy rollercoaster ride that has been Pepe, at least two Twitter accounts posted offers to mint free NFTs for anyone holding the memecoin.

Only the posted link advertises a supply of 10,000 available NFTs despite the obvious red flag of linking to a collection minted a few days ago and only had 6,969 total non-fungible tokens on offer.

""Navigating to the minting page of the tweet, you'll find a section titled 'Buy a Pepe NFT',"" which misleadingly redirects to an NFT collection named Lofi-Pepe, noted The Block Research Analyst Brad Kay. ""Funny enough, the official Lofi-Pepe collection, which launched on May 6th, caps at a (fitting) total supply of 6,969. This deceptive practice is a common tactic employed by scammers, luring unsuspecting buyers into fraudulent transactions.""



 

Example of misleading Pepe NFT tweet.

Crypto scams looking to latch onto the latest craze in digital assets, like this one with Pepe, have for years been such a common occurrence much of the market is numb to it. The two misleading Twitter posts have been reposted and liked tens of thousands of times — a process possibly driven by bots but one that nonetheless makes the pitch appear more genuine. 

Bots are such a problem, they almost stopped Elon Musk from going through with his purchase of Twitter last year. He has railed against the fake accounts, at one point saying he ""will defeat the spam bots or die trying.""

A call to connect their wallets

The suspicious link asks potential buyers to connect their wallets in order to mint one of the 10,000 Pepe NFTs. The link also references not only the official Lofi-Pepe collection but also the gaming platform Topia, which envisions itself as the ""next Minecraft."" It would appear linking to the two legitimate companies is an effort to make the link appear trustworthy.

Kay advises would-be purchasers of Pepe NFTs be increasingly vigilant. With the suspicious link, he said, “unwary investors may believe they're purchasing from the Lofi-Pepe collection, only to be defrauded of their tokens or inadvertently mint a different collection entirely.”


Both the Lofi-Pepe collection and Topia did not immediately respond for comment. A contact for the Twitter accounts promoting the seemingly fraudulent Pepe collection, @Miley18397515 and @StarkZ_ETHs, could not be found.

The official Lofi-Pepe collection has surpassed $2 million in trading volume since launching, according to CryptoSlam! data.

New capital to be used to help monetize brand’s IP including merchandising.

Roughly six months after Pudgy Penguins CEO denied the NFT collection was seeking to raise up to $10 million, it has announced securing $9 million in the completion of its seed round.

The round was led by 1kx, “an early-stage investment firm that specializes in ecosystem growth,” the collection said in a statement.  Big Brain Holdings, Kronos Research, the founders of LayerZero Labs, Old Fashion Research, and CRIT Ventures also participated, according to the statement.

Last November, Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz said The Block’s story that his collection sought to raise up to $10 million was “all wrong information,” and warned he would publicly brand any story on the subject “fake news.”

As the digital asset ecosystem grows and regulatory scrutiny increases, the importance of proper tracking & visibility – crypto accounting – does too. 

Few people get excited when they hear the word accounting, especially in the move-fast-and-break-things environment of innovative digital asset projects. However, proper digital asset accounting is wholly necessary to launching, managing, and building successful products and enterprises in digital assets and tokenization. Accounting is the unglamorous infrastructure needed to keep the shiny glowing surface that is Web3 alive. 

And think about it – when you build a house, you don’t skimp on the plumbing. If you do, you may eventually have to tear up the house to fix it, or even worse, faulty plumbing can cause the house to crumble or flood. It’s this analogy that correlates perfectly with digital asset accounting operations. When it comes to laying the pipes of digital asset accounting, you want to use the strongest, highest security, and most accurate. That’s what we’ve built at Ledgible.

As a SOC 1 & 2 Type 2 audited platform that works with leading enterprises and institutions like FIS, Thomson Reuters, Intuit, and large banks, Ledgible is the premium and trusted tool of choice for integrating proper digital asset accounting. So, let’s take a look at this process a little further, breaking down the basics of what you need to know.

At its core, Crypto accounting is the process of recording and tracking digital asset transactions for financial reporting and tax purposes. It is important for individuals, businesses, and organizations that own, trade, or mine cryptocurrencies to keep accurate records of their crypto-related activities.

Here are some of the must knows in the process of laying the framework for proper accounting in digital assets:

Identify your crypto assets: Determing which cryptocurrencies one owns, needs to manage, and what crypto verticals you work in is essential. To properly account for digital assets, one needs to keep track of the acquisition date, cost basis, and any fees associated with purchasing or trading the crypto assets, among a wealth of other accounting footnotes. This tracking, the part where non-accountants eyes may glaze over, is what Ledgible does automatically. Direct integration through APIs, automated basis and gain calculation, transaction tracing, you name it and Ledgible takes care of it.
Understand tax & accounting implications: Digital assets have varying regulations and treatments depending upon which geographical location one operates in. This non-standard treatment necessitates enterprises and investors have a firm grasp of their accounting. Navigating complex regulatory hurdles is made easier when one fully grasps the data they have at their fingertips. 
Keep detailed records: Record all crypto transactions, including purchases, sales, transfers, and mining activities. Make sure to keep detailed records of the date, amount, and value of each transaction. One could do this manually in a spreadsheet, or you could use the leading crypto accounting subledger, Ledgible, to take care of this tracking and data warehousing automatically.
Make things Ledgible: At Ledgible, we like to say we make crypto ledgible. In essence, our tools aggregate, normalize, and make Ledgible digital asset data for tax and accounting purposes. Serving as the translation step between digital assets and traditional financial processes. We run our own data layer to ensure data accuracy, built our own tax and accounting algorithms in-house with testing by leading accounting firms, and offer an ever-growing list of integrations with platforms. 

So, back to the original analogy. Most homeowners don’t love plumbing, they don’t spend their days obsessed with backwater valves and piping. They, instead, trust certified industry professionals to handle the dirty work. At Ledgible, we love digital asset tax and accounting – you can trust us to handle the mess.

QUICK TAKE
Goldman Sachs has found that 62% of surveyed family offices are not invested in and are not interested in investing in crypto, compared to 39% in 2021.
Still, more family offices are currently invested in crypto (26%) compared to 16% in 2021, per the latest survey.

Goldman Sachs' latest survey of institutional family office investors has found that interest in crypto has significantly faded among the wealthy elite, due to the extreme crypto market volatility of the past year.

The part of family offices that are not invested in crypto and are not interested in investing in it for the future has risen to 62% from 39% in 2021 when the investment banking giant first conducted its survey. The portion of those potentially interested in crypto investing for the future has also fallen to 12% from 45%, per the latest survey.

The results indicate a notable shift in sentiment after recent high-profile crypto collapses, including FTX, BlockFi and Celsius. Still, more family offices are currently invested in cryptocurrencies than in 2021 — 26% today, up from 16% — with the most-citing rationale being their ""belief in the power of blockchain technology.""

The survey captured responses from 166 family offices around the world, with a net worth of at least $500 million (93%) and 72% having at least $1 billion. The survey was conducted in January and February of this year.

 

Goldman Sachs uncovers fading crypto craze

During its last survey, in 2021, Goldman Sachs found that nearly half the family offices it did business with were interested in adding crypto to their investment portfolios because of ""higher inflation, prolonged low rates, and other macroeconomic developments following a year of unprecedented global monetary and fiscal stimulus.""

Now they are interested in increasing allocations to public and private equities and adding fixed-income exposure to capture higher rate opportunities.

 
""With the flexibility to invest across the risk spectrum, family offices have maintained a largely consistent approach to more aggressive allocations as they seek superior returns,"" Meena Flynn, co-head of global private wealth management and co-lead of One Goldman Sachs Family Office Initiative, said in a statement. ""Planned risk-on allocations tell us they see strong opportunities to capture added alpha. This patient, strategic, long-term orientation is often an advantage in managing and preserving generational wealth.""

While institutional interest in crypto might be waning, Goldman Sachs recently said it is open to adding more staff to its 70-person digital assets team while flagging the potential for blockchain technology to improve the functioning of markets such as private equity. Earlier today, Goldman Sachs participated in crypto infrastructure company Digital Asset's privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network, called the Canton Network, to provide a decentralized infrastructure for institutional clients.

QUICK TAKE
Sam Bankman-Fried has filed motions to dismiss many of the criminal charges filed against him in the collapse of FTX.
Bankman-Fried seeks to paint FTX’s practices as standard in the crypto industry, and lays blame with the U.S. government over its regulatory wrangling around digital assets over the last several years.

Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have come out swinging against federal prosecutors, seeking to preemptively dismiss most of the criminal charges made against the disgraced FTX co-founder and former CEO before a trial can take place.

A late filing on Monday by the fallen crypto mogul’s legal team seeks to toss fraud-related charges that they argue are duplicative, and also a campaign finance-related charge, on the grounds that the charge violates terms under which the Bahamian government extradited Bankman-Fried to the U.S. to face prosecution.

Bankman-Fried’s lawyers filed seven motions to dismiss charges brought against him, arguing that most could not be prosecuted by the government. The argument made by the former FTX and Alameda Research CEO’s defense team also seeks to paint the trading platform’s practices as standard in the crypto industry, and lay blame with the U.S. government over its regulatory wrangling around digital assets over the last several years.

Blame crypto and the government, not FTX, SBF lawyers say

Calling the U.S. government’s pursuit of Bankman-Fried “a classic rush to judgment,” the FTX and Alameda owner’s defense team argues that shortcomings leading to FTX’s demise are common throughout the crypto industry. They also contend the company’s failure stems from a broader crypto winter, rather than reported failure to back FTX’s native token FTT, or secret loans from FTX to Alameda alleged by both prosecutors and the bankruptcy team put in place to manage the repayment of FTX customers and creditors.

“Like many other cryptocurrency market participants, and many other start-ups that experience exponential growth in a short period, FTX did not have fully developed controls and risk management protocols,” Bankman-Fried’s lawyers told the judge presiding over the case. “FTX, like other market participants, was susceptible to a broader market collapse.”

Bankman-Fried’s team also argues that “every major participant” in the crypto industry “cratered,” and draws parallels between the collapse of different digital asset firms and the 2008 global financial crisis, the catalyst for the popularity of bitcoin and growth of digital assets.

Double jeopardy question

In the motions filed with the federal Southern District of New York, Bankman-Fried’s defense team argues that a conviction in either of two pairs of charges would be a convocation for the same crime, since the charges stem from similar portions of the law. Defendants cannot be convicted twice for the same crime in the U.S., termed a right against ""double jeopardy.""

The early defense effort argues that going to trial with multiple criminal charges that, in their eyes, could be canceled out by others he faces may lead to “undue prejudice” in his trial. It may also be an early effort by the defense to undermine the credibility of prosecutors in the eyes of a court or a future jury.

The pairs of charges in question are a charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and another of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on FTX customers; and a charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and another for conspiracy to commit commodities fraud on FTX customers. Bankman-Fried argues these pairs of charges are redundant, and that one of the charges from each pair should be withdrawn.

In separate but related motions to dismiss, the defense team also makes a series of more obscure legal arguments against other charges, including that the Bahamian government did not give its consent for some of the allegations brought against Bankman-Fried when it agreed to extradite him.

Crypto exchange Bittrex Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, less than a month after the SEC charged it with operating an unregistered exchange.
The company has an estimated $500 million to $1 billion in assets and liabilities, according to a court filing.

Bittrex Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Monday, less than a month after the Securities and Exchange Commissions charged it with running an unregistered exchange. 

The company said it had assets and liabilities each estimated to be worth between $500 million and $1 billion, and more than 100,000 creditors in a court filing. Two other entities, Bittrex Malta Ltd. and Bittrex Malta Holdings Ltd., also filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. 

The bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after Bittrex was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. Bittrex had previously said it would leave the U.S., blaming the country’s regulatory environment. 

Bittrex was once one of the largest exchanges in the U.S., with a market share of USD support of nearly 23% at the start of 2018, data from The Block show. It collapsed to below 1% in 2021 and hasn't recovered since.

QUICK TAKE
MakerDAO has introduced Spark, a DeFi lending protocol centered around the DAI stablecoin.
At first, users can borrow DAI using crypto assets as collateral at a 1.1% annual rate.

MakerDAO, the decentralized entity responsible for the DAI stablecoin, has unveiled Spark, a DeFi lending platform aimed at improving decentralized borrowing solutions for its stablecoin.

DAI is the fourth largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of $4.7 billion, trailing only USDT, USDC and BUSD.

Spark is a software fork of the leading lending protocol, Aave's Version 3, that integrates direct lending capabilities within MakerDAO. Through Spark, users can obtain DAI loans using assets such as ether (ETH), staked ether (stETH), and DAI. Spark functions independently from MakerDAO's primary mechanism, which solely permits users to generate new DAI as overcollateralized debt.

""Spark Protocol's first version, Spark Lend, is a lending marketplace specifically designed for supplying and borrowing crypto with a focus on DAI,"" MakerDAO stated. Starting Tuesday, the Spark Protocol will be accessible to all decentralized finance (DeFi) users, MakerDAO added.

Borrowers can initially take DAI loans at 1.11% annual rate through Spark. The lending platform incorporates a tailored interest rate model, wherein borrowing rates are established by governance members through on-chain voting, instead of fluctuating according to supply and demand as found in Aave or other lending protocols.

Spark will integrate with MakerDAO's Peg Stability Module, enabling instant conversion of DAI to USDC at a 1:1 ratio for users seeking stablecoin swaps. The creation of Spark was led by Phoenix Labs, a contributing firm to MakerDAO.

QUICK TAKE
The Pepe memecoin has made millionaires since its launch last month — at least on paper.
The top 15 pepe whales are sitting on cumulative profits currently worth $92.6 million, according to Lookonchain.
“$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only,” the pepe coin website states.

Pepe, a memecoin styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon, has made some crypto traders millions — at least on paper — as its price skyrocketed since launching last month.

The top 15 pepe whales — large holders of the tokens — are collectively sitting on potential profits that currently total $92.6 million, according to onchain data analyzed by Lookonchain. While the whales have sold some holdings, they still hold over 38 trillion pepe coins, or around 9% of its total supply, Lookonchain said.

The profits result from simple math. The whales paid an average of $0.0000000853 per token, and the current price of the coin is around $0.00000224. That's a lot of zeros, but it adds up to a gain of 2,526%, according to CoinGecko data.

Two of the top 15 whales are sitting on paper profits of over $11 million each, with the rest seeing gains between $2.9 million and $6.9 million, according to Lookonchain. One of the whales, however, has their address blacklisted, meaning they'll likely never be able to cash out.

Meme coin trading volumes are soaring, led by pepe. Last month, Dogecoin saw volatility after Elon Musk temporarily replaced the blue Twitter bird icon with an image of the doge dog. 

 

Pepe coin millionaires

While most of the profits are yet to be realized, Lookonchain data shows that three of the whales have sold pepe tokens with actual proceeds totaling between $1 million and $4 million. Some still appear to be HODLing, though, with six of the whales having yet to sell a single pepe token.

Trading strategies also appear to be quite diverse, too. The biggest whale currently holds 4.91 trillion tokens and has only cashed out about 5.1 billion for a total of $20,024. The next largest whale currently holds 4.76 trillion tokens but has sold 1.75 trillion tokens for a cool $4.2 million.

Pepe, which claims to be ""the most memeable memecoin in existence,"" was launched on April 15. The coin has no association with cartoonist Matt Furie, who created the Pepe the Frog cartoon character.

""This token is simply paying homage to a meme we all love and recognize,"" the pepe coin's website states. ""$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.""

Despite the warning, crypto enthusiasts have lapped up the coin and traded it massively. Pepe is currently the 53rd largest crypto token, with a market cap of over $940 million, according to CoinGecko data.

Pepe is down more than 25% over the past 24 hours

Crypto venture capital firm Master Ventures was also a pepe holder. It made around $470,000 from trading the coin and currently has no holdings in it, according to Lookonchain. Not everyone has made profits, however. At least one pepe investor was sitting on a paper loss of $500,000, as The Block reported over the weekend.

Steven Zheng, research director at The Block, said the current memecoin frenzy is similar to past NFT and DeFi waves, where early adopters made substantial profits from relatively small investments. “Unlike the two previous waves of DeFi and NFT, however, this time, the promotion of utility has been put on the back burner for pure unadulterated speculation,” Zheng said.

"Sam Altman’s Worldcoin rolls out app as token launch looms","May 8, 2023, 9:00AM EDT ","Sam Altman’s Worldcoin rolls out app as token launch looms

QUICK TAKE
The World App launches today in over 80 countries after a beta testing phase.
It will allow users to manage their World ID — as well as a range of cryptocurrencies that includes Worldcoin’s token — once that goes live later this year.

Worldcoin, the eyeball-scanning crypto project co-created by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, today announced the launch of a self-custodial mobile app.

The so-called World App gives users a way to manage their World ID, a tool for proving personhood online, alongside a range of cryptocurrencies — including BTC, ETH, DAI, USDC abd Worldcoin’s hotly anticipated token — once it launches.

Developed by Tools For Humanity, Worldcoin’s lead software contributor, the launch of the app comes a few months after the unveiling of World ID, the identity protocol that underpins the Worldcoin project. Momentum appears to be building towards the launch of Worldcoin’s token, which it has said previously will go live in the first half of this year. Users can claim their share of the coin by getting scanned by a Worldcoin orb.

Even in testing, the app has accrued 1.5 million users and logs 60,000 transactions on a typical day, the company said. Users can deposit and withdraw funds using bank accounts or local payment tools and can send money to phone contacts or crypto addresses.

“It’s already the fastest growing wallet in the world. Today every 14 seconds a person signs up to app,” said Tiago Sada, Head of Product, Engineering and Design at Tools For Humanity.

Keeping it simple

The World app, which had been in testing in a small number of locations, is now available for download in over 80 countries. It employs a minimalist design “with only the essential functionalities of the Worldcoin and Ethereum ecosystems,” according to the announcement.

TFH has also tried to simplify the product by offering “gas-free transactions,” which it can do by covering the gas fees. The company said the app is “engineered to maximize inclusivity.” It is available on iOS and Android, is around 18MB in size, is localized to multiple languages and can be supported by phones over 10 years old.  

“Everything at Worldcoin is about inclusivity,” Sada said, adding there is “potential” to introduce fees in the form of a few basis points for each transaction down the line.

A crypto who’s who

A who’s who of crypto firms, projects and tools power the app’s back end — including Uniswap for exchange tokens, ENS usernames that can be used to direct transfers, and Ramp and MoonPay for on and off-ramps. The beta version ran on Polygon, but the full version will be based on an Ethereum rollup, per the announcement.

“The other super interesting thing about the app is just thinking about what all of these financial and identity primitives together allow you to do,” Sada said.

Worldcoin is valued at $3 billion after reportedly raising $100 million from Khosla Ventures and a16z in March 2022. The Block revealed in February that the company is seeking another round of funding at the same valuation.

QUICK TAKE
Tokens created on Bitcoin have surpassed a combined market value of $900 million.
Ordi, a memecoin, leads the BRC-20 token niche with a fully diluted value of $540 million.

Tokens created on Bitcoin through the Ordinals protocol have exceeded a total market value of $900 million, highlighting the rapid rise of an emerging asset niche on the most valuable blockchain.

Ordi memecoin lead the BRC-20 category with a fully diluted value exceeding half a billion dollars, based on data from websites brc-20.io and Ordspace. That's after a 22,500% jump to $25 today from $0.11 at the beginning of April amid the ongoing memecoin mania.

Memecoins make up the majority of tokens created using BRC-20, a recently-developed token standard for Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol. These Bitcoin-based tokens are comparable to ERC-20, the token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. Introduced by developed Casey Rodarmor in January, the protocol allows for indexing and monitoring of every satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, across the network. 

Currently, Ordi has a fully diluted market cap of $525 million considering a token supply of 21 million. The token became available for trading today on Gate.io, the first centralized crypto exchange to list the top BRC-20 token.

Within the BRC-20 market segment, Ordi is trailed by other meme assets on Bitcoin, such as Meme, Domo, and Nals, which have individual market caps ranging between $8 million and $20 million.

What is the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin?

The Ordinals protocol allows developers  to assign a distinct identity or file onto every satoshi within the Bitcoin network, a process called inscription. This mechanism set the stage for the development of both fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like BRC-20 tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which frequently showcase digital art. 

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

00:00 / 00:00

While the Ordinals core team devised a method for generating NFTs on Bitcoin, another pseudonymous developer named Domo introduced an experimental token standard built upon the Ordinals protocol called BRC-20 in March. This enabled users to issue fungible tokens like ordi and others with the help of incsribing specific files to satoshis.

Since then, the number of tokens created on Bitcoin using Ordinals has experienced a dramatic increase. In merely the past few months, over 11,000 tokens have been generated, and the trading activity surrounding these tokens has contributed to a substantial uptick in daily transactions on the Bitcoin network, going to a record high of 534,000, as per The Block data. Consequently, this has also led to a steep rise in network fees over the last week.

QUICK TAKE
Coinbase’s executive team, including CEO Brian Armstrong, is in the UAE this week to meet with the region’s policymakers, among others. 
The team’s first UAE visit comes amid souring relations with American regulators.

Crypto exchange Coinbase is bolstering its relationship with regulatory authorities in the United Arab Emirates as it faces mounting challenges back home in the U.S.

""There is no doubt that UAE has the potential to be a strategic hub for Coinbase, amplifying our efforts across the world,"" Coinbase said in a blog post on Sunday. ""It further serves as a particularly strategic bridge between Asia and Europe — two of our existing focus international regions to date.""

Coinbase's executive team, including CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong, is in the UAE this week for meetings with policymakers, regulators, crypto founders and clients. Armstrong will also provide a keynote address at the inaugural Dubai Fintech Summit. Armstrong admired the UAE for its proactive and progressive regulatory approach to crypto in a tweet, saying the region ""deserves a lot of credit for being forward thinking on crypto.""

""First dedicated crypto regulator in the world, a clear rule book published (!), business friendly plus strong customer protections. Really enjoying my visit so far,"" he added.

Coinbase's tensions with US regulators grow

Coinbase's first visit to the UAE, in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, comes amid souring relations with American regulators and a nascent effort to move beyond the U.S. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sent Coinbase a Wells notice alerting the exchange to ""possible violations of securities laws."" In April, Coinbase sued the SEC in order to force the agency to respond to a petition that the company filed demanding the SEC publish specific rules for digital assets. Last week, the SEC was ordered by a U.S. court to respond to Coinbase's complaint within ten days.

Also last week, Coinbase launched an international derivatives exchange from Bermuda, allowing users to trade perpetual futures with currently 5x leverage.

""It is no secret that Coinbase is also working with Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulators to further expand the licensing and availability for Coinbase International Exchange,"" Coinbase said in the Sunday blog post. ""We have also been engaging with Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), a dedicated regulator for virtual assets, as they put forward a comprehensive retail framework built on the principles of economic sustainability and cross-border financial security. This expands our global footprint, helping get us closer to bringing 1 billion users to crypto.""

UAE's growing crypto ecosystem

The UAE has witnessed significant growth in its crypto ecosystem over the past few years, attracting attention from giants such as Binance.

Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority was set up last year, and earlier this year, it issued its crypto regulatory framework, laying out a concrete licensing regime for crypto service providers. Last month, the registration authority of ADGM issued a consultation paper to explain the proposed Distributed Ledger Technology Foundations Regulations 2023 and sought public feedback on the proposed new legislative framework for foundations that facilitate DLT and token issuance.

""In short, the region is standing-out as a leader in the development of a web3 ecosystem, making it an attractive location to consider investing in,"" Coinbase said. ""The vacuum created by other notable jurisdictions means that international counterparts, such as the UAE, are racing to fill the regulatory gap.""

Despite regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., Coinbase is ""100% committed"" to the home country over the long term, Armstrong said last week during the company's earnings call.

""Let me be clear, we're 100% committed to the U.S. I founded this company in the United States because I saw that rule of law prevails here,"" Armstrong said. ""That's really important, and I'm actually really optimistic on the U.S. getting this right.""

QUICK TAKE
Binance paused and restarted bitcoin withdrawals twice in less than 12 hours.
Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao called concerns around halts “FUD,” blaming Bitcoin network congestion and fees.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao this morning dismissed concerns after the exchange paused and restarted bitcoin withdrawals twice in less than 12 hours.

Zhao said in response to comments about the exchange's bitcoin withdrawal issues ,""4"" — his personal code for ""Ignore FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.""

""4. There are some FUD about BTC withdrawal issues,"" Zhao, known by his initials ""CZ,"" tweeted Monday. He pointed to Bitcoin network's high transaction fees as the main reason for the temporary withdrawal halts.

Some users had expressed concerns that Binance in fact halted withdrawals because of billions of dollars of withdrawals from the exchange and worried that the network congestion explanation could be cover for the company needing to replenish its hot wallets. Binance quickly addressed those concerns, saying: ""We're aware that some data are showing a large volume of outflows from Binance. This 'outflow' are actually movements between Binance hot and cold wallets due to the BTC address adjustments.""

Binance indeed moved 157,000 bitcoin (worth around $4.4 billion) between its hot and cold wallets on Sunday, according to CryptoQuant's head of research Julio Moreno. Binance's net withdrawals were likely only around 10,100 bitcoin (over $282 million), Moreno added.

Binance's bitcoin withdrawal pauses and resumptions

Binance first paused bitcoin withdrawals for around two hours on Sunday afternoon U.S. time, citing network congestion. Its second pause occurred Sunday evening U.S. time and normal service resumed after about two hours.

Binance said a large volume of pending transactions on the Bitcoin network caused the withdrawal issues. Transactions were pending because the bitcoin transaction fees that had been set by Binance did not anticipate the transaction surge. Binance reacted by increasing the fees for pending transactions to be picked up by miners, and then resumed withdrawals.

In addition to the block rewards, bitcoin miners also get transaction fees. When users send Bitcoin transactions, they have the option to attach a fee to incentivize miners to prioritize their transactions. Higher fee transactions generally get processed faster.

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

CATARINA MOURA
00:00 / 00:00

""To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed,"" Binance said. ""Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.""

Bitcoin Lightning Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning Network fees are generally lower compared to on-chain Bitcoin transaction fees because the Lightning Network operates off-chain, reducing the burden on the main blockchain.

Bitcoin network congestion

Pending transactions on the Bitcoin network hit a record high of over 400,000 on Sunday, higher than anything seen during the bull runs of 2018 and 2021, according to on-chain data. The number is still higher than 400,000.

The recent launch of the Ordinals protocol appears to be the main cause of Bitcoin network congestion and high fees. Ordinals, created by Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor, facilitates the creation of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals Inscriptions continue to climb, as The Block reported recently. Inscriptions, similar to NFTs, are metadata inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a bitcoin. Using Ordinal Inscriptions, people can directly inscribe text, images and even videos on the Bitcoin blockchain.

 

The price of bitcoin continues to trend lower and is now at $28,170, down 2.8% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

The pepe coin price fell to $0.00000259 on Sunday after peaking at $0.00000420 on Friday.
One large trader is sitting on paper losses of $500,000 after buying near the top. 

Pepe fell for a second day on Sunday as the crypto token styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon meme left at least one investor sitting on paper losses of $500,000. 

Pepe is currently trading at $0.00000259, according to Coingecko data. The price peaked at $0.00000420 on Friday, which may or may not be related to the weed-related 4:20 meme. 

The slide has left at least one large trader nursing paper losses. The data firm Lookonchain noted on Sunday that a so-called whale bought 962.3 billion PEPE for an average price of $0.000003122. At the current price, that trade is about $500,000 in the red. 

Memecoins take a recognisable internet meme and add an element of financial speculation. They have a long history in crypto, even if they have zero utility. While early adopters can make big profits on the way up, those who buy near the top can end up sitting on huge losses.

The losses on Saturday came as Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, offered clients the chance to trade the token for the first time. Binance listed the pepe memecoin despite warning that ""the token has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team.""

Pepe coin trading volume 

Pepe has recently exploded into the consciousness of crypto traders, with trading volume topping $250 million in 24 hours last week — exceeding that for both dogecoin and shiba inu . Those trading the token on Uniswap have burned more than $10 million in Ethereum transaction fees over the past three weeks, on-chain data show.

Even after the recent decline, the token has a market cap just over $1 billion, making it the 45th most value crypto token, according to Coingecko.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Binance was used to allow Russians to evade U.S. sanctions, according to a Bloomberg report.

The Justice Department is investigating whether crypto exchange giant Binance was used to let Russians evade U.S. sanctions, Bloomberg reported.

The probe into the world’s largest crypto exchange is tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Justice Department’s national security division is leading the investigation, which is running in parallel to another inquiry by the agency’s criminal division. 

Binance told Bloomberg it complies with all U.S. and international financial sanctions.

“In 2021, Binance launched an initiative to completely overhaul its corporate governance structure, including bringing in a world-class bench of seasoned executives to fundamentally change how Binance operates globally,” Binance said in a statement to Bloomberg. “Our policy imposes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money.”

CFTC accused Binance

News of the DOJ probe comes as law enforcement and U.S. regulators increase scrutiny of the crypto industry. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused Binance of “willful evasion of federal law” and “operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange” in a March enforcement action.

Internal Binance messages included in the CFTC complaint show that Binance executives discussed transactions by the U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hamas on the exchange in 2019, for example. Binance officers even acknowledged some of their customers are “here for crime” on the platform, but said, “we see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.”

QUICK TAKE
State of New York Attorney General Letitia James is proposing legislation that would force crypto firms to pay back customers who are victims of fraud.
The legislation would also prevent the creators of crypto assets from owning crypto platforms and would stop firms from borrowing or lending investor assets.

State of New York Attorney General Letitia James escalated her office's crackdown on the crypto industry on Friday with proposed legislation that would force companies to refund customers who are victims of fraud.

""My office is introducing nation-leading legislation to tighten regulations on the cryptocurrency industry,” James said on Twitter. “For too long, fraud in the cryptocurrency industry has caused investors to lose hundreds of billions, with low-income investors and people of color suffering the most.”

The new bill would be the latest effort by James’ office to increase its oversight of crypto firms. She sued crypto exchanges CoinEx and KuCoin earlier this year, along with former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, and the attorney general also put out a call for crypto whistleblowers last summer.

The state already has one of the toughest regulatory regimes for crypto companies in the U.S. with its BitLicense that's overseen by New York's Department of Financial Services, or NYDFS.

“We're proposing commonsense measures to protect investors and end the fraud and dysfunction that have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency,” James said. ""Banks and other financial services are regulated. The cryptocurrency industry must be too.""

New York state lawmakers comment on proposal 

A group of state lawmakers praised the bill in a press release, but it wasn't clear who might officially sponsor the legislation. State senators and assembly members mentioned in the statement, all Democrats, include Kevin Thomas, Cordell Cleare, Kevin Parker, Kristen Gonzalez, James Sanders Jr., Steve Otis, Michaelle Solages, Inez E. Dickens, Pamela J. Hunter, Alex Bores, Rebecca Seawright and Anna Kelles. 

""I believe the Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight (CRPTO) Act as proposed by the New York State Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in collaboration with the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) will prove to be beneficial for our communities as it will shield even the most vulnerable investors from financial exploitation,” Sen. James Sanders Jr., the Chairman of the Committee on Banks, said in the statement.

The attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The program bill will be submitted to the State Senate and Assembly ""for their consideration during the 2023 legislative session,"" the press release said.

 

State of New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted about the new crypto bill.

New York AG's crypto bill would stop firms from borrowing or lending investor assets

The bill, as proposed by the attorney general, would require crypto companies to refund customers who are victims of fraud the way banks do. It would also give the attorney general’s office power to enforce tighter regulations for the industry and “force” independent and public auditing of crypto companies. 

The legislation would also address conflicts of interest and and bolster investor protection. It would “prevent people who create crypto assets from also owning crypto platforms” and stop crypto firms from borrowing or lending investor assets.

Investors would also receive risk and conflict of interest information about crypto companies, James said.

“My office has taken action to stop cryptocurrency companies from operating illegally,” she said. “Our bill will continue New York’s legacy as a top financial leader to protect investors and our economy.”

QUICK TAKE
Civ Kit will be open to anyone from anywhere to do as they please.

Paxful co-founder Ray Youssef has big plans to reopen peer-to-peer trading after his company collapsed earlier this year. And it won’t be in the U.S.

His new initiative, called Civ Kit, is a “blueprint for developers and entrepreneurs to build their own censorship-resistant and permissionless global marketplace.”

It’s what Youssef calls an “unstoppable marketplace” that will allow anyone, anywhere, to trade using the Lightning Network and Nostr, a protocol that enables decentralized social media.

“We want everyone to be trading with everyone. We want someone in Venezuela trading with someone in Russia,” Youssef said on a recent podcast with The Block’s Frank Chaparro. “No barriers, no permission required.

The endeavor comes on the heels of the implosion of Paxful, which he founded in 2015 with Artur Shaback, who is now suing Youssef. In the face of legal uncertainty in the U.S. — though nothing imminent — Paxful had decided in November to dissolve the company — a “nice, tidy dissolving,” Youssef said.

“We spent all the money on compliance to make sure that any frozen funds were released back to the users and then there wouldn't be any creditors,” Youssef said. Shaback, however, “decided to sue me because he wouldn't get his nine-figure payday if the company dissolved. So it was purely out of greed.”

Shaback responds

Shaback said the two “had differences in the business direction and governance of Paxful,” and that Youssef migrated Paxful’s IP, userbase, wallet history and passwords to a new venture, Noones.com.

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

“He could not take me with him due to me being a U.S. resident,” Shaback said in an email to The Block, adding that he may not continue pursuing the lawsuit as it takes time and resources and may instead seek a settlement.

“”Paxful was able and is able to function and serve billions of people worldwide and that is my goal now to restore it,” Shaback said.

Know your peer

Instead of ""Know-Your-Customer,"" Civ Kit will use “know-your-peer (KYP) oracles.""

“KYC is horrible,” Youssef said. “People want to know who they're trading with, especially for big transactions. And that's where we replace KYC with Swipe Your Peer … We can start attaching reputation to accounts based on the nature of people's trading activity.”

Youssef said while there are several such marketplaces in the works, “the difference is that Civ Kit is built by someone, designed by someone that's already done it out in the real world and seen every possible problem in a case.”

(Updates with comments from Shaback starting in seventh paragraph.)

The pepe memecoin climbed past $1 billion in market cap, pushing it into the ranks of the top 50 most valuable crypto tokens. 
Binance announced it would list the token today, while warning that it “has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team.”

Pepe, a crypto token styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon meme, climbed past $1 billion in market cap for the first time as traders pushed it into the top 50 most valuable coins. 

One pepe is currently worth $0.00000279, according to data provider CoinGecko. The token has risen 67% over the past 24 hours and surged more than 10-fold over the past week, making pepe the 45th largest by market value.  

Memecoins — which take a recognisable internet meme and add an element of financial speculation — have a long history in crypto, even if they have zero utility. Naive investors can be drawn into their parabolic gains, which have a habit of crashing suddenly and leaving those who bought near the top nursing huge losses. 

Two dog-themed tokens — dogecoin and shiba inu — have become fixtures in the ranks of the most valuable crypto projects since the pandemic-fueled market action of 2020 and 2021. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has regularly tweeted his appreciation for dogecoin, often with his tongue at least partly in his cheek, and research firms such as Chainalysis have bowed to pressure to cover it. 

""This is the purest representation of crypto’s speculative prowess,"" said Steven Zheng, research director at The Block Research. 

The gains in pepe came as Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, announced it would list the token for the first time. Binance clients will be able to trade pepe from Saturday.  

""Please note that the token has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team,"" Binance warned in its announcement.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added on Twitter, ""Meme coins (and all crypto) are high risk! Remember, no one is forcing you to buy them. [Do your own research] and be responsible for your own actions.""

Pepe volume overtakes dogecoin

For now, at least, pepe appears to have taken the crown as crypto's favorite memecoin. Earlier this week, trading volume for pepe exceeded that for both dogecoin and shiba inu. 

In fact, those trading the token on Uniswap have burned more than $10 million in Ethereum transaction fees — where a portion of the fee is destroyed instead of going to miners — over the last three weeks. This has boosted the amount of ether getting burned on the network, which is now up to around $60 million per week.

Despite the huge paper gains, those looking to cash in by selling might struggle with a lack of liquidity. A Nansen report this week highlighted one pepe early adopter selling $2.2 million of the token but only receiving $650,000 in ether “due to massive slippage.” 

Despite the skepticism, Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, highlighted that renewed interest in memecoins could have wider importance for crypto markets.

""Under the surface, we are starting to see increased activity that the more speculative parts of the crypto industry are awakening after almost a year in hibernation,"" Thielen wrote in a report.

As the artificial intelligence field continues to grow, the initial excitement has to faded and been replaced with fear, distrust, and a general unease. This comes as the media publishes headlines that read “A.I. is ‘one of the biggest risks’ to civilization” and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.

Humans vs Machines

After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.’s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving

cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That’s why augmented intelligence is the future. It’s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production – as it has happened after every technological revolution.

One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator’s own words, is designed “to empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.” Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what’s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. – Augmented Intelligence.

Case Study

The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control – like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human’s hand is continuously on Morgan’s “steering wheel.” The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn’t more parameters, it’s more quality and domain specific training.

MORGAN’s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like

MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower’s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:

This is the epitome of augmented intelligence — humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.

"Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering","May 5, 2023, 6:26AM EDT ","Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering

QUICK TAKE
A problematic transaction has caused issues for Bitcoin collectibles project Ordinals.
The transaction upset its inscription numbering system, according to developers discussing the issue.

Ordinals, the system by which digital collectibles are written onto the Bitcoin blockchain, is facing a new challenge after a developer found a way to introduce a bug into the metadata. 

The problem occurred when a developer known as Supertestnet initiated a transaction that didn’t output a satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but was seen as valid in the Ordinals system. As a result, it knocked the numbering system that Ordinals uses for its inscriptions off by one. 

“It shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own, so this is a bug. However, fixing the bug by making [Ordinals] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” said Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on GitHub.

Ordinals provide a way to store NFTs on Bitcoin after network upgrades made it easier and cheaper to store larger amounts of data. Inscriptions are the metadata added to satoshis that may include information as digital entries on Bitcoin's distributed public ledger.

Supertestnet also released a tool and related instructions for anyone else who wants to create the same types of problematic transactions. They illustrated their GitHub post with an image reading ""I am become Supertestnet, destroyer of JPEGs.""

 

Source: GitHub

Bitcoin Ordinals not broken yet

The bug isn't a huge problem as it doesn’t break the main Ordinals system of tracking satoshis, which are linked to collectibles, argued Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy. Instead, it refers to inscription numbers, a vanity metric marking the order in which each Ordinal collectible was created.

“This is totally fine,"" Diekroeger said on Twitter. ""In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway.” 

His view was backed by a developer known as Rijndael who said there shouldn’t be any impact on the actual Ordinals themselves, only the inscription numbering system.

Diekroeger also noted that the original transaction contained an inscription that promoted an alternative system for creating collectibles on Bitcoin called Soma.

QUICK TAKE
Volumes have fallen steeply for Art Blocks, the generative art platform that boomed in the last crypto bull run. 
But founder Erick Calderon remains unwavering on topics such as creator royalties, while dismissing excessive fundraising as “gross.”
“I’m a little bit timid and hesitant… because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

By his own admission, Erick “Snowfro” Calderon is not a typical crypto founder.

Before founding Art Blocks, a marketplace for computer-generated artworks, he spent 20 years running a ceramic tile business. During the last bull market, he claims to have turned down multiple investment offers that would have valued Art Blocks at over $1 billion. He stands firm on the need to uphold creator royalties in the NFT space. And he has resisted the temptation to launch an Art Blocks token.

But most iconoclastic of all, he isn’t convinced there will be another crypto bull run.

“There are people that would accuse us of being not ambitious enough with the amount of funds that we have left,” Calderon, who is also Art Blocks’ CEO, said in an interview. “The reason that I’m a little bit timid and hesitant is because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

Art Blocks is in the business of auctioning off generative art in the form of NFT collections created by algorithms, albeit within parameters set by human artists. The platform was a darling of the 2021 crypto boom. In a single month in August 2021, it sold no less than $587 million worth of NFTs, according to CryptoSlam data.

But times have changed for Art Blocks, much as they have in the wider crypto space. The business recorded just $6.5 million in sales in April, the lowest total since May 2021. Around half the projects listed on the platform today don’t sell out, according to Calderon.

Yet Calderon, who is himself a generative artist, is stubborn. Even as volumes wane, he has stuck to his guns on topics such as creator royalties — despite other marketplaces in the sector deciding to waive them for the benefit of traders. While this and similar strategic choices are costing Art Blocks money in the short-term, Calderon remains optimistic.

“The vibes are negative, but the vision is very resolute,” he said. “I’m just as excited today — I’m maybe more excited today — than I was in 2021 and I just want people to know that.”

Art Blocks' royalties pain

Art Blocks’ stance on royalties — the levy paid to creators on secondary sales of their NFTs — is an apt illustration of how the business has positioned itself.

Blur, the recently launched NFT marketplace targeting pro traders, set its royalty fee at just 0.5% in February. In response, rival OpenSea dropped its 2.5% fee to zero for a limited time.

Art Blocks, which has a secondary market of its own, continues to enforce full royalty fees of 5%. That means collectors must spend more to buy an NFT on Art Blocks than they would for the same NFT on Blur or OpenSea. Inevitably, that has put a dent in revenues.

“Art Blocks has lost a significant amount of income as a result of royalties,” Calderon said, adding that the royalty fees had previously provided the bulk of the firm’s event budgets.

But Calderon thinks artists create higher quality work — in part because it’s less necessary for them to continually produce — and are generally more engaged with their audiences when royalties are upheld. “To me it just seems very straightforward that the ecosystem will be a better place if royalties are respected,” he added.

Blur, Calderon said, is “the antithesis of being about the art,” and is much more focused on market mechanics and traders. “I’m also very frustrated with what’s happening, but if it wasn’t them, it would be somebody else doing it,” Calderon said.

Art Blocks' unicorn snub

Even with revenue down, Art Blocks remains a ""well-capitalized company,” according to Calderon.

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

The startup may not have raised at a billion-dollar valuation, but it did bring in some cash through a $6 million round that closed in August 2021. True Ventures, Galaxy Interactive and Collab Currency invested alongside existing backers Libertus Capital, Flamingo DAO and The LAO.

The bulk of the capital at Art Blocks’ disposal today, however, comes from the revenue it booked in the bull run. The company takes a 10% fee on primary sales and 2.5% of any secondary transactions, according to its website. A straightforward calculation suggests, therefore, that Art Blocks banked at least $58 million in revenue in the month of August 2021 alone.

“We had a crazy year in 2021,” Calderon said. Naturally, after the $6 million round, bigger backers came knocking.

Calderon said he fielded offers both to invest in Art Blocks and to buy the company outright at valuations in excess of $1 billion. He declined to name the investors.

“Why we didn’t raise more money? Because I thought it would be gross to raise more money when everything was just peak FOMO,” he said. “I’m sitting here thinking, ‘OK yeah, I can see that from the numbers now, but what on earth makes you think that these numbers are going to continue forever?’ It’s completely unreasonable.”

Cost-wise, the operation appears to have stayed fairly lean; Calderon said Art Blocks’ current headcount is 40 people. And as alluded to earlier, Art Blocks does not seem to burn through cash quite so hungrily as the average tech startup. Calderon sees a runway of one to two years as “too low,” mindful of the often-stellar jobs his staff left to join what remains a fairly zany startup.

Carry on canoeing

Keep calm and carry on seems to be the basis of Calderon’s plan for navigating a rough period for crypto firms.

“We’re in a canoe, going down a river that’s moving very fast, with tiny little paddles, and all we can do just from a mental health standpoint is just keep f---ing doing what we’re doing,” he said.

Which is not to say that Art Blocks doesn’t have any new ideas in the works. Calderon speaks enthusiastically about potential use cases for Art Blocks’ on-demand minting technology — at the heart of which is the 1 of 1 of X concept — in other industries, such as fashion or even ceramic tiles. Art Blocks is hoping to position the platform as an “engine partner” for such endeavors, Calderon said.

In October last year, Tyler Hobbs, creator of an Art Blocks’ smash hit collection called Fidenza, made $17 million selling passes that gave buyers a level of control over the look of NFTs minted from his QQL collection. By toying with knobs and dials, pass-holders can manipulate the QQL algorithm to suit their fancy.

Art Blocks is working on new minting mechanics of its own, due next quarter, Calderon said. There will be less of a manual element, however.

Calderon acknowledges that Art Blocks must hit “homeostasis” at some point. To do that, the startup and indeed the industry needs to find ways to access a bigger market.

“Some people are just so focused on extracting every last dollar from every last person in the industry that are here, that they’re not spending any time on thinking, ‘how do I make this thing appealing to the outside world?’ And I think that’s where we could shoot ourselves in the foot as an industry,” Calderon said.  

“If Art Blocks doesn’t make it through this, it’s like the value proposition of the NFT just disappears.”

QUICK TAKE
Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow’s team denies she invested in NFT project called Wild. The company disputes the claim.
Celebrities who once fawned over them have been turning their back on digital assets in the wake of a downturn in the industry and fallout from scandals like FTX’s collapse.
“Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” according to Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain

Two months ago, a little-known NFT startup geared toward helping up-and-coming artists introduced itself to the world. Dubbed Wild, it sported a bevy of business luminaries as backers like founders Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Kevin Lin of Twitch.

But leading the headlines at the time, both in The Block's reporting and elsewhere, was actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The Oscar winner and founder of the multimillion-dollar Goop wellness brand empire was reported at the time to have invested in Wild. Now that's in dispute.

Nearly two months later, a representative of Paltrow’s said over the weekend that it was “completely false” that she invested in Wild, while a spokesperson for Wild later said in a statement that the “initial reporting is correct.”

Paltrow’s team seemingly distancing her from a crypto-related project after the fact — Wild used her name online as far back as March when The Block and others initially reported the actress’s  involvement — is just the latest example in an ongoing parade of once-eager celebrities turning their back on the digital assets industry.

“We’ve obviously seen the implosion of crypto,” said Les Borsai, a veteran of the music industry who co-founded Wave Digital Assets. “We’ve seen the SEC go after celebrities. There’s concern. So it’s not the usual greed mechanism kicking in to say ‘I can go do a crypto thing, or a web3 thing, without consequence.’ Their representation is not stupid.”

Fallon, Damon and FTX boosters

Last year “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon stopped using a Bored Ape NFT as his avatar on Twitter and the market began to sour. Actor Matt Damon said he took money to do a Crypto.com advertisement because he needed money for his nonprofit that helps people access clean water and sanitation. Shaquille O’Neal said he was ""just a paid spokesperson"" for FTX – and is facing a class-action suit – for his decision to promote the now disgraced crypto trading platform.

Although it comes weeks after the news of Paltrow’s now disputed investment was made public, Paltrow’s team was stern in their denial, repeating it three times by email.

“We were alerted to the story on Gwyneth Paltrow backing web3 art platform Wild,” Goop EVP Noora Raj Brown said in her first email denying her boss’s involvement, sent last Saturday. “This story is completely false and Gwyneth is not an investor in the platform.” 

The Block corrected its early March story based upon Brown’s email, stripping it of any mention of Paltrow. At the original time of publishing, Wild founder and Chief Executive J. Douglass Kobs told The Block in a written interview that Paltrow had invested in the web3 company alongside Matrix Partners, LinkedIn's Hoffman and Twitch's Lin.

Wild's CEO says he met Paltrow at a leadership summit

In the March story about Wild, Kobs said that he and Paltrow became friends after meeting at a leadership summit in 2021, adding that she's an ""early adopter"" of web3 and NFTs. The crypto news outlet Decrypt also reported the news of Paltrow's involvement, as did CoinDesk. Evidence of Paltrow’s disputed involvement also exists elsewhere online, including a link to Wild's original announcement accessible from OpenSea, a premiere NFT marketplace.

It is not unheard of for projects to announce a slate of backers only to have some publicly refute any such involvement. Just this week, Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek issued a statement denying it had invested in a crypto startup named Array. Last month, no less than four supposed backers of the fledgling OPNX exchange said they weren’t investors after the startup had claimed they were.

Celebrity advisors have for months been trying to help their clients avoid getting mixed up in an industry still going through serious growing pains and intense regulatory and political scrutiny.

Months ago, ​one top Hollywood agent told The Block his firm was spending a significant amount of time advising clients against promoting crypto-related projects. “You don’t want to go and do something that is going to jeopardize your credibility in the space,” they said at the time.

Not enough marketing dollars

The current trend of fewer celebrity endorsements of crypto projects is also being driven by companies having less money to spend on marketing, said Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain.

Speaking from personal experience, Georgiades said he had multiple discussions with celebrities enthusiastic about working on a NFT project only to have them later retract “any interest in getting involved” when they felt they were not being properly compensated. Even if he didn’t take the news well, he understands their perspective. “Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” he said.

Borsai, who is passionate about creating a new paradigm with web3 that will redefine the rights celebrities and influencers possess in terms of monetizing the content they create and their reach, said he dreams of a world where the crypto endorsements of the past are not repeated.   

“I don’t believe we should live in a culture where we pay Kim Kardashian $2 million dollars to speak about something she doesn’t understand,” said Borsai. “That’s why she got in trouble with the SEC. I would never use anyone like Kim Kardashian.”

Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax on Instagram and then the SEC penalized her, forcing her to pay $1.26 million, the regulatory agency said last year.

Coinbase EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than estimates of negative $36 million. 
Interest income rose to $240 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC.
Coinbase is ‘fully prepared’ to face off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it says.

Coinbase reported first-quarter revenue up 22% as cost-cutting measures paid dividends. Shares popped 7% in after-hours trading.

Interest income rose 32% to $240 million, above estimates of $205 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC. In the fourth quarter, interest income totaled $182 million, of which $146 million was USDC.

The cryptocurrency exchange said revenue for the first quarter was $736 million, coming in above the $658 million estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than the negative $36 million estimated. 

Subscription and services helped drive this growth, said the firm's vice president of investor relations, Anil Gupta, in an interview with The Block following the release. Subscription and services revenue, which included staking and interest income, was $362 million, above estimates of $316 million. 

The declining circulating supply of USDC may have a more outsized impact on Coinbase's revenue as the year progresses, Mizuho's Ryan Coyne told The Block ahead of time. Gupta confirmed the exchange expects interest income derived from USDC to fall in the second quarter due to this.

Staking accounted for $73.7 million, above the $71 million estimated by FactSet. It did, however, lead to an increase in transaction expenses as rewards are paid out to users, the firm noted. Staking was under the microscope during the first quarter. Kraken reached a $30 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in Coinbase tumbled as the SEC came down on staking as staking revenues came under threat.

Trading volume was flat quarter on quarter, marking the first time since the crypto winter began the exchange's quarterly volume did not decline. Monthly transacting users climbed modestly to 8.4 million from 8.3 million.
 
Coinbase ‘fully prepared' to fight the SEC

Coinbase also provided shareholders with an update on its looming legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a key U.S. regulator. The SEC gave Coinbase official notice that it was the subject of an investigation last month with a Wells Notice, a document that can precede an enforcement action.

The company responded to the notice last week, warning that an enforcement action against Coinbase would not be in the country’s interest. Separately, Coinbase is suing the SEC to answer its request for a digital asset-specific rule.

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the SEC, they have not shared their specific concerns with Coinbase or provided any clarity or workable path forward for the industry. While we hope to avoid litigation, we are fully prepared to defend ourselves and advocate for the entire crypto industry if necessary,” Coinbase wrote in its shareholder letter.

Coinbase said its “preferred path would be for Congress to take action to provide clear rules of the road for the industry.” The exchange hinted that “real action” could be taken on “substantive, bipartisan legislation” during the second quarter of 2023, which ends in June.

“We are also digging in on our direct advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. We need crypto-specific rules and regulation, not more enforcement, to help this innovative technology flourish and for America to maintain its leadership position,” the letter said.

Block sold $2.2 billion in bitcoin in Q1 2023 via Cash App.
That figure represents a 25% year-over-year increase, according to Block’s quarterly results. 

Block, formerly known as Square, reported surging sales of bitcoin on its Cash App platform in the first quarter of the year. 

In an earnings release on Thursday, the company said it sold $2.2 billion worth of bitcoin in the quarter, a 25% year-over-year increase. That's also an increase from $1.8 billion sold in the fourth quarter of last year.

Gross profits from bitcoin sales were $50 million, according to the Q1 shareholder letter. 

""The year-over-year increase in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of bitcoin compared to the prior-year period,"" Block said.

Voyager Digital is preparing to liquidate after its deal to sell assets to Binance.US fell apart.
The bankrupt lender could start making distributions “within the next few weeks.”

Bankrupt lender Voyager Digital could start distributing cash and crypto to creditors “within the next few weeks,” according to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the troubled crypto lender’s bankruptcy case.

The firm is finalizing the liquidation procedures after crypto exchange Binance.US pulled out of a $1.3 billion deal to buy its assets.

“Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors,” the creditors committee said on Twitter. ""We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.

The court-approved restructuring plan had included a “toggle” that allowed Voyager to liquidate if Binance.US decided to exit the deal. The crypto exchange said it backed away from the plan due to the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

The failed deal between Voyager and Binance.US was met with government scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in a court hearing that staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the country, although the commission hasn’t taken an official position.

Voyager bankruptcy asset recovery

Voyager must first file the liquidation procedures in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and parties will then have 10 days to object to the plan. The company said it had more than 100,000 creditors when it filed for bankruptcy protection last summer.

“If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go ‘effective’ with the plan at that time,” the committee said."" If an objection is filed, the Court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go effective.""

Of the 6% of creditors who voted on the proposed Voyager restructuring plan, 97% voted in favor. Customers would have seen a 73% recovery of assets under the Binance.US proposal, although that percentage could have dropped to 48% if claims from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sibling Alameda Research are eventually successful.

With Star Wars NFTs, Disney takes one step closer into the world of crypto.
The digital toys will cost $39.99.

With wannabe Jedis rattling their lightsabers around the world in honor of Thursday's Star Wars Day celebrations, Cryptoys has announced it will be selling — in partnership with Disney — digital toys fashioned after three of the movie franchises' most iconic characters.

Cryptoys, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Mattel and Dapper Labs, said it will release “15 limited-edition Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Darth Vader collectible digital toys.”

Although The Walt Disney Company is one of the most successful marketers and sellers of merchandise based on famous intellectual property, the Hollywood studio and theme park operator has yet to make a big foray into crypto.

Last year, the media conglomerate advertised a job opening for a transaction lawyer to explore emerging technology opportunities, according to a posting on LinkedIn.

Powered by Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, consumers can buy Cryptoys Star Wars NFTs for $39.99. Purchases will be possible with Apple  Pay and Google Pay, “worldwide,” according to the company.

"Biden wants 'to get rid of crypto,' Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warns","May 4, 2023, 12:50PM EDT ","Biden wants 'to get rid of crypto,' Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warns

QUICK TAKE
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who’s a possible presidential candidate in next year’s election, alleged there were people that ‘want to get rid of crypto.’
DeSantis said this week that legislation to ban central bank digital currencies in the state is advancing.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the Sunshine state would soon move against any kind of a central bank digital currency, with lawmakers advancing with legislation that could be on his desk within ""the next couple of weeks.""

""Florida rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on May 2. ""You could just get fined, and they'll just take it right out of your digital currency, without any due process or anything like that. And so it gives the government a huge amount of power over your economic self sufficiency and independence.""

The Republican is an avid critic of centrally controlled digital currencies, but he's expressed support in the past for decentralized cryptocurrencies because the government has no control over them.

DeSantis, who's widely considered as a possible presidential candidate in next year's election, has previously accused President Joe Biden of eyeing the technology for “surveillance and control.” He first announced the legislation that would outlaw centralized digital currencies in the state in March. 

His Tuesday comments came amid widespread discussion of what's been perceived by some to be a broad crackdown on the crypto sector by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase, a U.S.-listed crypto exchange, is suing the regulator and calling for clear rules.  

Crypto crackdown

""They want to get rid of crypto,"" DeSantis said. ""They don't like crypto because they can't control crypto, so they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency.""

""My view is is like, if you want to invest in crypto, it's up to you,"" DeSantis continued. ""You can do it. I mean, like, you can make those decisions.""

DeSantis' press office said in an emailed response to questions that he was referring to ""those such as the Biden Administration."" In the Tuesday remarks, the governor said an agenda was being imposed by an ""elite"" with access to ""to a lot of financial might, a lot of business resources, corporate resources.""

DeSantis said the pending legislation in Florida would provide preemptive protection from a U.S. central bank digital currency, even though one doesn't yet exist.  

DeSantis warns against 'financial surveillance state'

""I don't think Congress would authorize it,"" DeSantis said. ""But if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally, in Florida, we'll have a prohibition against that. And I think that that's ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don't have a financial surveillance state, where they know every transaction that you're making.""

DeSantis first raised his opposition to centralized digital currencies last year, but he has previously taken a friendlier approach toward decentralized tokens and has said he was working on ways for Floridians to pay taxes with crypto.

The Biden administration has developed policy objectives for a possible CBDC system in the U.S., with the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department both conducting research in the area.

QUICK TAKE
The pepe memecoin climbed past $1 billion in market cap, pushing it into the ranks of the top 50 most valuable crypto tokens. 
Binance announced it would list the token today, while warning that it “has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team.”

Pepe, a crypto token styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon meme, climbed past $1 billion in market cap for the first time as traders pushed it into the top 50 most valuable coins. 

One pepe is currently worth $0.00000279, according to data provider CoinGecko. The token has risen 67% over the past 24 hours and surged more than 10-fold over the past week, making pepe the 45th largest by market value.  

Memecoins — which take a recognisable internet meme and add an element of financial speculation — have a long history in crypto, even if they have zero utility. Naive investors can be drawn into their parabolic gains, which have a habit of crashing suddenly and leaving those who bought near the top nursing huge losses. 

Two dog-themed tokens — dogecoin and shiba inu — have become fixtures in the ranks of the most valuable crypto projects since the pandemic-fueled market action of 2020 and 2021. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has regularly tweeted his appreciation for dogecoin, often with his tongue at least partly in his cheek, and research firms such as Chainalysis have bowed to pressure to cover it. 

""This is the purest representation of crypto’s speculative prowess,"" said Steven Zheng, research director at The Block Research. 

The gains in pepe came as Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, announced it would list the token for the first time. Binance clients will be able to trade pepe from Saturday.  

""Please note that the token has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team,"" Binance warned in its announcement.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added on Twitter, ""Meme coins (and all crypto) are high risk! Remember, no one is forcing you to buy them. [Do your own research] and be responsible for your own actions.""

Pepe volume overtakes dogecoin

For now, at least, pepe appears to have taken the crown as crypto's favorite memecoin. Earlier this week, trading volume for pepe exceeded that for both dogecoin and shiba inu. 

In fact, those trading the token on Uniswap have burned more than $10 million in Ethereum transaction fees — where a portion of the fee is destroyed instead of going to miners — over the last three weeks. This has boosted the amount of ether getting burned on the network, which is now up to around $60 million per week.

Despite the huge paper gains, those looking to cash in by selling might struggle with a lack of liquidity. A Nansen report this week highlighted one pepe early adopter selling $2.2 million of the token but only receiving $650,000 in ether “due to massive slippage.” 

Despite the skepticism, Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, highlighted that renewed interest in memecoins could have wider importance for crypto markets.

""Under the surface, we are starting to see increased activity that the more speculative parts of the crypto industry are awakening after almost a year in hibernation,"" Thielen wrote in a report.

As the artificial intelligence field continues to grow, the initial excitement has to faded and been replaced with fear, distrust, and a general unease. This comes as the media publishes headlines that read “A.I. is ‘one of the biggest risks’ to civilization” and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.

Humans vs Machines

After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.’s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving

cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That’s why augmented intelligence is the future. It’s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production – as it has happened after every technological revolution.

One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator’s own words, is designed “to empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.” Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what’s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. – Augmented Intelligence.

Case Study

The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control – like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human’s hand is continuously on Morgan’s “steering wheel.” The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn’t more parameters, it’s more quality and domain specific training.

MORGAN’s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like

MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower’s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:

This is the epitome of augmented intelligence — humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.

"Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering","May 5, 2023, 6:26AM EDT ","Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering

QUICK TAKE
A problematic transaction has caused issues for Bitcoin collectibles project Ordinals.
The transaction upset its inscription numbering system, according to developers discussing the issue.

Ordinals, the system by which digital collectibles are written onto the Bitcoin blockchain, is facing a new challenge after a developer found a way to introduce a bug into the metadata. 

The problem occurred when a developer known as Supertestnet initiated a transaction that didn’t output a satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but was seen as valid in the Ordinals system. As a result, it knocked the numbering system that Ordinals uses for its inscriptions off by one. 

“It shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own, so this is a bug. However, fixing the bug by making [Ordinals] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” said Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on GitHub.

Ordinals provide a way to store NFTs on Bitcoin after network upgrades made it easier and cheaper to store larger amounts of data. Inscriptions are the metadata added to satoshis that may include information as digital entries on Bitcoin's distributed public ledger.

Supertestnet also released a tool and related instructions for anyone else who wants to create the same types of problematic transactions. They illustrated their GitHub post with an image reading ""I am become Supertestnet, destroyer of JPEGs.""

 

Source: GitHub

Bitcoin Ordinals not broken yet

The bug isn't a huge problem as it doesn’t break the main Ordinals system of tracking satoshis, which are linked to collectibles, argued Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy. Instead, it refers to inscription numbers, a vanity metric marking the order in which each Ordinal collectible was created.

“This is totally fine,"" Diekroeger said on Twitter. ""In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway.” 

His view was backed by a developer known as Rijndael who said there shouldn’t be any impact on the actual Ordinals themselves, only the inscription numbering system.

Diekroeger also noted that the original transaction contained an inscription that promoted an alternative system for creating collectibles on Bitcoin called Soma.

QUICK TAKE
Volumes have fallen steeply for Art Blocks, the generative art platform that boomed in the last crypto bull run. 
But founder Erick Calderon remains unwavering on topics such as creator royalties, while dismissing excessive fundraising as “gross.”
“I’m a little bit timid and hesitant… because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

By his own admission, Erick “Snowfro” Calderon is not a typical crypto founder.

Before founding Art Blocks, a marketplace for computer-generated artworks, he spent 20 years running a ceramic tile business. During the last bull market, he claims to have turned down multiple investment offers that would have valued Art Blocks at over $1 billion. He stands firm on the need to uphold creator royalties in the NFT space. And he has resisted the temptation to launch an Art Blocks token.

But most iconoclastic of all, he isn’t convinced there will be another crypto bull run.

“There are people that would accuse us of being not ambitious enough with the amount of funds that we have left,” Calderon, who is also Art Blocks’ CEO, said in an interview. “The reason that I’m a little bit timid and hesitant is because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

Art Blocks is in the business of auctioning off generative art in the form of NFT collections created by algorithms, albeit within parameters set by human artists. The platform was a darling of the 2021 crypto boom. In a single month in August 2021, it sold no less than $587 million worth of NFTs, according to CryptoSlam data.

But times have changed for Art Blocks, much as they have in the wider crypto space. The business recorded just $6.5 million in sales in April, the lowest total since May 2021. Around half the projects listed on the platform today don’t sell out, according to Calderon.

Yet Calderon, who is himself a generative artist, is stubborn. Even as volumes wane, he has stuck to his guns on topics such as creator royalties — despite other marketplaces in the sector deciding to waive them for the benefit of traders. While this and similar strategic choices are costing Art Blocks money in the short-term, Calderon remains optimistic.

“The vibes are negative, but the vision is very resolute,” he said. “I’m just as excited today — I’m maybe more excited today — than I was in 2021 and I just want people to know that.”

Art Blocks' royalties pain

Art Blocks’ stance on royalties — the levy paid to creators on secondary sales of their NFTs — is an apt illustration of how the business has positioned itself.

Blur, the recently launched NFT marketplace targeting pro traders, set its royalty fee at just 0.5% in February. In response, rival OpenSea dropped its 2.5% fee to zero for a limited time.

Art Blocks, which has a secondary market of its own, continues to enforce full royalty fees of 5%. That means collectors must spend more to buy an NFT on Art Blocks than they would for the same NFT on Blur or OpenSea. Inevitably, that has put a dent in revenues.

“Art Blocks has lost a significant amount of income as a result of royalties,” Calderon said, adding that the royalty fees had previously provided the bulk of the firm’s event budgets.

But Calderon thinks artists create higher quality work — in part because it’s less necessary for them to continually produce — and are generally more engaged with their audiences when royalties are upheld. “To me it just seems very straightforward that the ecosystem will be a better place if royalties are respected,” he added.

Blur, Calderon said, is “the antithesis of being about the art,” and is much more focused on market mechanics and traders. “I’m also very frustrated with what’s happening, but if it wasn’t them, it would be somebody else doing it,” Calderon said.

Art Blocks' unicorn snub

Even with revenue down, Art Blocks remains a ""well-capitalized company,” according to Calderon.

The startup may not have raised at a billion-dollar valuation, but it did bring in some cash through a $6 million round that closed in August 2021. True Ventures, Galaxy Interactive and Collab Currency invested alongside existing backers Libertus Capital, Flamingo DAO and The LAO.

The bulk of the capital at Art Blocks’ disposal today, however, comes from the revenue it booked in the bull run. The company takes a 10% fee on primary sales and 2.5% of any secondary transactions, according to its website. A straightforward calculation suggests, therefore, that Art Blocks banked at least $58 million in revenue in the month of August 2021 alone.

“We had a crazy year in 2021,” Calderon said. Naturally, after the $6 million round, bigger backers came knocking.

Calderon said he fielded offers both to invest in Art Blocks and to buy the company outright at valuations in excess of $1 billion. He declined to name the investors.

“Why we didn’t raise more money? Because I thought it would be gross to raise more money when everything was just peak FOMO,” he said. “I’m sitting here thinking, ‘OK yeah, I can see that from the numbers now, but what on earth makes you think that these numbers are going to continue forever?’ It’s completely unreasonable.”

Cost-wise, the operation appears to have stayed fairly lean; Calderon said Art Blocks’ current headcount is 40 people. And as alluded to earlier, Art Blocks does not seem to burn through cash quite so hungrily as the average tech startup. Calderon sees a runway of one to two years as “too low,” mindful of the often-stellar jobs his staff left to join what remains a fairly zany startup.

Carry on canoeing

Keep calm and carry on seems to be the basis of Calderon’s plan for navigating a rough period for crypto firms.

“We’re in a canoe, going down a river that’s moving very fast, with tiny little paddles, and all we can do just from a mental health standpoint is just keep f---ing doing what we’re doing,” he said.

Which is not to say that Art Blocks doesn’t have any new ideas in the works. Calderon speaks enthusiastically about potential use cases for Art Blocks’ on-demand minting technology — at the heart of which is the 1 of 1 of X concept — in other industries, such as fashion or even ceramic tiles. Art Blocks is hoping to position the platform as an “engine partner” for such endeavors, Calderon said.

In October last year, Tyler Hobbs, creator of an Art Blocks’ smash hit collection called Fidenza, made $17 million selling passes that gave buyers a level of control over the look of NFTs minted from his QQL collection. By toying with knobs and dials, pass-holders can manipulate the QQL algorithm to suit their fancy.

Art Blocks is working on new minting mechanics of its own, due next quarter, Calderon said. There will be less of a manual element, however.

Calderon acknowledges that Art Blocks must hit “homeostasis” at some point. To do that, the startup and indeed the industry needs to find ways to access a bigger market.

“Some people are just so focused on extracting every last dollar from every last person in the industry that are here, that they’re not spending any time on thinking, ‘how do I make this thing appealing to the outside world?’ And I think that’s where we could shoot ourselves in the foot as an industry,” Calderon said.  

“If Art Blocks doesn’t make it through this, it’s like the value proposition of the NFT just disappears.”

QUICK TAKE
Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow’s team denies she invested in NFT project called Wild. The company disputes the claim.
Celebrities who once fawned over them have been turning their back on digital assets in the wake of a downturn in the industry and fallout from scandals like FTX’s collapse.
“Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” according to Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain

Two months ago, a little-known NFT startup geared toward helping up-and-coming artists introduced itself to the world. Dubbed Wild, it sported a bevy of business luminaries as backers like founders Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Kevin Lin of Twitch.

But leading the headlines at the time, both in The Block's reporting and elsewhere, was actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The Oscar winner and founder of the multimillion-dollar Goop wellness brand empire was reported at the time to have invested in Wild. Now that's in dispute.

Nearly two months later, a representative of Paltrow’s said over the weekend that it was “completely false” that she invested in Wild, while a spokesperson for Wild later said in a statement that the “initial reporting is correct.”

Paltrow’s team seemingly distancing her from a crypto-related project after the fact — Wild used her name online as far back as March when The Block and others initially reported the actress’s  involvement — is just the latest example in an ongoing parade of once-eager celebrities turning their back on the digital assets industry.

“We’ve obviously seen the implosion of crypto,” said Les Borsai, a veteran of the music industry who co-founded Wave Digital Assets. “We’ve seen the SEC go after celebrities. There’s concern. So it’s not the usual greed mechanism kicking in to say ‘I can go do a crypto thing, or a web3 thing, without consequence.’ Their representation is not stupid.”

Fallon, Damon and FTX boosters

Last year “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon stopped using a Bored Ape NFT as his avatar on Twitter and the market began to sour. Actor Matt Damon said he took money to do a Crypto.com advertisement because he needed money for his nonprofit that helps people access clean water and sanitation. Shaquille O’Neal said he was ""just a paid spokesperson"" for FTX – and is facing a class-action suit – for his decision to promote the now disgraced crypto trading platform.

Although it comes weeks after the news of Paltrow’s now disputed investment was made public, Paltrow’s team was stern in their denial, repeating it three times by email.

“We were alerted to the story on Gwyneth Paltrow backing web3 art platform Wild,” Goop EVP Noora Raj Brown said in her first email denying her boss’s involvement, sent last Saturday. “This story is completely false and Gwyneth is not an investor in the platform.” 

The Block corrected its early March story based upon Brown’s email, stripping it of any mention of Paltrow. At the original time of publishing, Wild founder and Chief Executive J. Douglass Kobs told The Block in a written interview that Paltrow had invested in the web3 company alongside Matrix Partners, LinkedIn's Hoffman and Twitch's Lin.

Wild's CEO says he met Paltrow at a leadership summit

In the March story about Wild, Kobs said that he and Paltrow became friends after meeting at a leadership summit in 2021, adding that she's an ""early adopter"" of web3 and NFTs. The crypto news outlet Decrypt also reported the news of Paltrow's involvement, as did CoinDesk. Evidence of Paltrow’s disputed involvement also exists elsewhere online, including a link to Wild's original announcement accessible from OpenSea, a premiere NFT marketplace.

It is not unheard of for projects to announce a slate of backers only to have some publicly refute any such involvement. Just this week, Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek issued a statement denying it had invested in a crypto startup named Array. Last month, no less than four supposed backers of the fledgling OPNX exchange said they weren’t investors after the startup had claimed they were.

Celebrity advisors have for months been trying to help their clients avoid getting mixed up in an industry still going through serious growing pains and intense regulatory and political scrutiny.

Months ago, ​one top Hollywood agent told The Block his firm was spending a significant amount of time advising clients against promoting crypto-related projects. “You don’t want to go and do something that is going to jeopardize your credibility in the space,” they said at the time.

Not enough marketing dollars

The current trend of fewer celebrity endorsements of crypto projects is also being driven by companies having less money to spend on marketing, said Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain.

Speaking from personal experience, Georgiades said he had multiple discussions with celebrities enthusiastic about working on a NFT project only to have them later retract “any interest in getting involved” when they felt they were not being properly compensated. Even if he didn’t take the news well, he understands their perspective. “Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” he said.

Borsai, who is passionate about creating a new paradigm with web3 that will redefine the rights celebrities and influencers possess in terms of monetizing the content they create and their reach, said he dreams of a world where the crypto endorsements of the past are not repeated.   

“I don’t believe we should live in a culture where we pay Kim Kardashian $2 million dollars to speak about something she doesn’t understand,” said Borsai. “That’s why she got in trouble with the SEC. I would never use anyone like Kim Kardashian.”

Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax on Instagram and then the SEC penalized her, forcing her to pay $1.26 million, the regulatory agency said last year.

Coinbase EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than estimates of negative $36 million. 
Interest income rose to $240 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC.
Coinbase is ‘fully prepared’ to face off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it says.

Coinbase reported first-quarter revenue up 22% as cost-cutting measures paid dividends. Shares popped 7% in after-hours trading.

Interest income rose 32% to $240 million, above estimates of $205 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC. In the fourth quarter, interest income totaled $182 million, of which $146 million was USDC.

The cryptocurrency exchange said revenue for the first quarter was $736 million, coming in above the $658 million estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than the negative $36 million estimated. 

Subscription and services helped drive this growth, said the firm's vice president of investor relations, Anil Gupta, in an interview with The Block following the release. Subscription and services revenue, which included staking and interest income, was $362 million, above estimates of $316 million. 

The declining circulating supply of USDC may have a more outsized impact on Coinbase's revenue as the year progresses, Mizuho's Ryan Coyne told The Block ahead of time. Gupta confirmed the exchange expects interest income derived from USDC to fall in the second quarter due to this.

Staking accounted for $73.7 million, above the $71 million estimated by FactSet. It did, however, lead to an increase in transaction expenses as rewards are paid out to users, the firm noted. Staking was under the microscope during the first quarter. Kraken reached a $30 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in Coinbase tumbled as the SEC came down on staking as staking revenues came under threat.  

Trading volume was flat quarter on quarter, marking the first time since the crypto winter began the exchange's quarterly volume did not decline. Monthly transacting users climbed modestly to 8.4 million from 8.3 million.
 
Coinbase ‘fully prepared' to fight the SEC

Coinbase also provided shareholders with an update on its looming legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a key U.S. regulator. The SEC gave Coinbase official notice that it was the subject of an investigation last month with a Wells Notice, a document that can precede an enforcement action.

The company responded to the notice last week, warning that an enforcement action against Coinbase would not be in the country’s interest. Separately, Coinbase is suing the SEC to answer its request for a digital asset-specific rule.

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the SEC, they have not shared their specific concerns with Coinbase or provided any clarity or workable path forward for the industry. While we hope to avoid litigation, we are fully prepared to defend ourselves and advocate for the entire crypto industry if necessary,” Coinbase wrote in its shareholder letter.

Coinbase said its “preferred path would be for Congress to take action to provide clear rules of the road for the industry.” The exchange hinted that “real action” could be taken on “substantive, bipartisan legislation” during the second quarter of 2023, which ends in June.

“We are also digging in on our direct advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. We need crypto-specific rules and regulation, not more enforcement, to help this innovative technology flourish and for America to maintain its leadership position,” the letter said.

QUICK TAKE
Block sold $2.2 billion in bitcoin in Q1 2023 via Cash App.
That figure represents a 25% year-over-year increase, according to Block’s quarterly results. 

Block, formerly known as Square, reported surging sales of bitcoin on its Cash App platform in the first quarter of the year. 

In an earnings release on Thursday, the company said it sold $2.2 billion worth of bitcoin in the quarter, a 25% year-over-year increase. That's also an increase from $1.8 billion sold in the fourth quarter of last year.

Gross profits from bitcoin sales were $50 million, according to the Q1 shareholder letter. 

""The year-over-year increase in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of bitcoin compared to the prior-year period,"" Block said.

Block profits rise

Block reported an overall gross profit of $1.7 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase, with total revenue of just under $5 billion in the period. 

""Transaction-based revenue was $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up 15% year over year, and transaction-based gross profit was $602 million, up 16% year over year,"" Block said.

Cash App profits were $931 million and Square profits weighed in at $770 million, representing year-over-year increases of 49% and 16%, respectively. 

This report will be updated with additional information from Block's 5 p.m. ET earnings call.

QUICK TAKE
Voyager Digital is preparing to liquidate after its deal to sell assets to Binance.US fell apart.
The bankrupt lender could start making distributions “within the next few weeks.”

Bankrupt lender Voyager Digital could start distributing cash and crypto to creditors “within the next few weeks,” according to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the troubled crypto lender’s bankruptcy case.

The firm is finalizing the liquidation procedures after crypto exchange Binance.US pulled out of a $1.3 billion deal to buy its assets.

“Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors,” the creditors committee said on Twitter. ""We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.

The court-approved restructuring plan had included a “toggle” that allowed Voyager to liquidate if Binance.US decided to exit the deal. The crypto exchange said it backed away from the plan due to the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

The failed deal between Voyager and Binance.US was met with government scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in a court hearing that staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the country, although the commission hasn’t taken an official position.


Voyager bankruptcy asset recovery

Voyager must first file the liquidation procedures in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and parties will then have 10 days to object to the plan. The company said it had more than 100,000 creditors when it filed for bankruptcy protection last summer.

“If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go ‘effective’ with the plan at that time,” the committee said."" If an objection is filed, the Court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go effective.""

Of the 6% of creditors who voted on the proposed Voyager restructuring plan, 97% voted in favor. Customers would have seen a 73% recovery of assets under the Binance.US proposal, although that percentage could have dropped to 48% if claims from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sibling Alameda Research are eventually successful.

With Star Wars NFTs, Disney takes one step closer into the world of crypto.
The digital toys will cost $39.99.

With wannabe Jedis rattling their lightsabers around the world in honor of Thursday's Star Wars Day celebrations, Cryptoys has announced it will be selling — in partnership with Disney — digital toys fashioned after three of the movie franchises' most iconic characters.

Cryptoys, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Mattel and Dapper Labs, said it will release “15 limited-edition Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Darth Vader collectible digital toys.”

Although The Walt Disney Company is one of the most successful marketers and sellers of merchandise based on famous intellectual property, the Hollywood studio and theme park operator has yet to make a big foray into crypto.

Last year, the media conglomerate advertised a job opening for a transaction lawyer to explore emerging technology opportunities, according to a posting on LinkedIn.

Powered by Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, consumers can buy Cryptoys Star Wars NFTs for $39.99. Purchases will be possible with Apple  Pay and Google Pay, “worldwide,” according to the company.

QUICK TAKE
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who’s a possible presidential candidate in next year’s election, alleged there were people that ‘want to get rid of crypto.’
DeSantis said this week that legislation to ban central bank digital currencies in the state is advancing.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the Sunshine state would soon move against any kind of a central bank digital currency, with lawmakers advancing with legislation that could be on his desk within ""the next couple of weeks.""

""Florida rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on May 2. ""You could just get fined, and they'll just take it right out of your digital currency, without any due process or anything like that. And so it gives the government a huge amount of power over your economic self sufficiency and independence.""

The Republican is an avid critic of centrally controlled digital currencies, but he's expressed support in the past for decentralized cryptocurrencies because the government has no control over them.

DeSantis, who's widely considered as a possible presidential candidate in next year's election, has previously accused President Joe Biden of eyeing the technology for “surveillance and control.” He first announced the legislation that would outlaw centralized digital currencies in the state in March. 

His Tuesday comments came amid widespread discussion of what's been perceived by some to be a broad crackdown on the crypto sector by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase, a U.S.-listed crypto exchange, is suing the regulator and calling for clear rules.  

Crypto crackdown

""They want to get rid of crypto,"" DeSantis said. ""They don't like crypto because they can't control crypto, so they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency.""

""My view is is like, if you want to invest in crypto, it's up to you,"" DeSantis continued. ""You can do it. I mean, like, you can make those decisions.""

DeSantis' press office said in an emailed response to questions that he was referring to ""those such as the Biden Administration."" In the Tuesday remarks, the governor said an agenda was being imposed by an ""elite"" with access to ""to a lot of financial might, a lot of business resources, corporate resources.""

DeSantis said the pending legislation in Florida would provide preemptive protection from a U.S. central bank digital currency, even though one doesn't yet exist.  

DeSantis warns against 'financial surveillance state'

""I don't think Congress would authorize it,"" DeSantis said. ""But if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally, in Florida, we'll have a prohibition against that. And I think that that's ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don't have a financial surveillance state, where they know every transaction that you're making.""

DeSantis first raised his opposition to centralized digital currencies last year, but he has previously taken a friendlier approach toward decentralized tokens and has said he was working on ways for Floridians to pay taxes with crypto.

The Biden administration has developed policy objectives for a possible CBDC system in the U.S., with the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department both conducting research in the area.

(Updates with response from DeSantis press office in eighth paragraph.)

QUICK TAKE
The pepe memecoin climbed past $1 billion in market cap, pushing it into the ranks of the top 50 most valuable crypto tokens. 
Binance announced it would list the token today, while warning that it “has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team.”

Pepe, a crypto token styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon meme, climbed past $1 billion in market cap for the first time as traders pushed it into the top 50 most valuable coins. 

One pepe is currently worth $0.00000279, according to data provider CoinGecko. The token has risen 67% over the past 24 hours and surged more than 10-fold over the past week, making pepe the 45th largest by market value.  

Memecoins — which take a recognisable internet meme and add an element of financial speculation — have a long history in crypto, even if they have zero utility. Naive investors can be drawn into their parabolic gains, which have a habit of crashing suddenly and leaving those who bought near the top nursing huge losses. 

Two dog-themed tokens — dogecoin and shiba inu — have become fixtures in the ranks of the most valuable crypto projects since the pandemic-fueled market action of 2020 and 2021. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has regularly tweeted his appreciation for dogecoin, often with his tongue at least partly in his cheek, and research firms such as Chainalysis have bowed to pressure to cover it. 

""This is the purest representation of crypto’s speculative prowess,"" said Steven Zheng, research director at The Block Research. 

The gains in pepe came as Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, announced it would list the token for the first time. Binance clients will be able to trade pepe from Saturday.  

""Please note that the token has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team,"" Binance warned in its announcement.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added on Twitter, ""Meme coins (and all crypto) are high risk! Remember, no one is forcing you to buy them. [Do your own research] and be responsible for your own actions.""

Pepe volume overtakes dogecoin

For now, at least, pepe appears to have taken the crown as crypto's favorite memecoin. Earlier this week, trading volume for pepe exceeded that for both dogecoin and shiba inu. 

In fact, those trading the token on Uniswap have burned more than $10 million in Ethereum transaction fees — where a portion of the fee is destroyed instead of going to miners — over the last three weeks. This has boosted the amount of ether getting burned on the network, which is now up to around $60 million per week.

Despite the huge paper gains, those looking to cash in by selling might struggle with a lack of liquidity. A Nansen report this week highlighted one pepe early adopter selling $2.2 million of the token but only receiving $650,000 in ether “due to massive slippage.” 

Despite the skepticism, Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, highlighted that renewed interest in memecoins could have wider importance for crypto markets.

""Under the surface, we are starting to see increased activity that the more speculative parts of the crypto industry are awakening after almost a year in hibernation,"" Thielen wrote in a report.

As the artificial intelligence field continues to grow, the initial excitement has to faded and been replaced with fear, distrust, and a general unease. This comes as the media publishes headlines that read “A.I. is ‘one of the biggest risks’ to civilization” and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.

Humans vs Machines

After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.’s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving

cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That’s why augmented intelligence is the future. It’s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production – as it has happened after every technological revolution.

One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator’s own words, is designed “to empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.” Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what’s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. – Augmented Intelligence.

Case Study

The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control – like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human’s hand is continuously on Morgan’s “steering wheel.” The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn’t more parameters, it’s more quality and domain specific training.

MORGAN’s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like

MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower’s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:

This is the epitome of augmented intelligence — humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.

QUICK TAKE
A problematic transaction has caused issues for Bitcoin collectibles project Ordinals.
The transaction upset its inscription numbering system, according to developers discussing the issue.

Ordinals, the system by which digital collectibles are written onto the Bitcoin blockchain, is facing a new challenge after a developer found a way to introduce a bug into the metadata. 

The problem occurred when a developer known as Supertestnet initiated a transaction that didn’t output a satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but was seen as valid in the Ordinals system. As a result, it knocked the numbering system that Ordinals uses for its inscriptions off by one. 

“It shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own, so this is a bug. However, fixing the bug by making [Ordinals] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” said Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on GitHub.

Ordinals provide a way to store NFTs on Bitcoin after network upgrades made it easier and cheaper to store larger amounts of data. Inscriptions are the metadata added to satoshis that may include information as digital entries on Bitcoin's distributed public ledger.

Supertestnet also released a tool and related instructions for anyone else who wants to create the same types of problematic transactions. They illustrated their GitHub post with an image reading ""I am become Supertestnet, destroyer of JPEGs.""

 

Source: GitHub

Bitcoin Ordinals not broken yet

The bug isn't a huge problem as it doesn’t break the main Ordinals system of tracking satoshis, which are linked to collectibles, argued Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy. Instead, it refers to inscription numbers, a vanity metric marking the order in which each Ordinal collectible was created.

“This is totally fine,"" Diekroeger said on Twitter. ""In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway.” 

His view was backed by a developer known as Rijndael who said there shouldn’t be any impact on the actual Ordinals themselves, only the inscription numbering system.

Diekroeger also noted that the original transaction contained an inscription that promoted an alternative system for creating collectibles on Bitcoin called Soma.

"As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run","May 5, 2023, 5:00AM EDT ","As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run

QUICK TAKE
Volumes have fallen steeply for Art Blocks, the generative art platform that boomed in the last crypto bull run. 
But founder Erick Calderon remains unwavering on topics such as creator royalties, while dismissing excessive fundraising as “gross.”
“I’m a little bit timid and hesitant… because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

By his own admission, Erick “Snowfro” Calderon is not a typical crypto founder.

Before founding Art Blocks, a marketplace for computer-generated artworks, he spent 20 years running a ceramic tile business. During the last bull market, he claims to have turned down multiple investment offers that would have valued Art Blocks at over $1 billion. He stands firm on the need to uphold creator royalties in the NFT space. And he has resisted the temptation to launch an Art Blocks token.

But most iconoclastic of all, he isn’t convinced there will be another crypto bull run.

“There are people that would accuse us of being not ambitious enough with the amount of funds that we have left,” Calderon, who is also Art Blocks’ CEO, said in an interview. “The reason that I’m a little bit timid and hesitant is because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

Art Blocks is in the business of auctioning off generative art in the form of NFT collections created by algorithms, albeit within parameters set by human artists. The platform was a darling of the 2021 crypto boom. In a single month in August 2021, it sold no less than $587 million worth of NFTs, according to CryptoSlam data.

But times have changed for Art Blocks, much as they have in the wider crypto space. The business recorded just $6.5 million in sales in April, the lowest total since May 2021. Around half the projects listed on the platform today don’t sell out, according to Calderon.

Yet Calderon, who is himself a generative artist, is stubborn. Even as volumes wane, he has stuck to his guns on topics such as creator royalties — despite other marketplaces in the sector deciding to waive them for the benefit of traders. While this and similar strategic choices are costing Art Blocks money in the short-term, Calderon remains optimistic.

“The vibes are negative, but the vision is very resolute,” he said. “I’m just as excited today — I’m maybe more excited today — than I was in 2021 and I just want people to know that.”

Art Blocks' royalties pain

Art Blocks’ stance on royalties — the levy paid to creators on secondary sales of their NFTs — is an apt illustration of how the business has positioned itself.

Blur, the recently launched NFT marketplace targeting pro traders, set its royalty fee at just 0.5% in February. In response, rival OpenSea dropped its 2.5% fee to zero for a limited time.

Art Blocks, which has a secondary market of its own, continues to enforce full royalty fees of 5%. That means collectors must spend more to buy an NFT on Art Blocks than they would for the same NFT on Blur or OpenSea. Inevitably, that has put a dent in revenues.

“Art Blocks has lost a significant amount of income as a result of royalties,” Calderon said, adding that the royalty fees had previously provided the bulk of the firm’s event budgets.

But Calderon thinks artists create higher quality work — in part because it’s less necessary for them to continually produce — and are generally more engaged with their audiences when royalties are upheld. “To me it just seems very straightforward that the ecosystem will be a better place if royalties are respected,” he added.

Blur, Calderon said, is “the antithesis of being about the art,” and is much more focused on market mechanics and traders. “I’m also very frustrated with what’s happening, but if it wasn’t them, it would be somebody else doing it,” Calderon said.

Art Blocks' unicorn snub

Even with revenue down, Art Blocks remains a ""well-capitalized company,” according to Calderon.

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

The startup may not have raised at a billion-dollar valuation, but it did bring in some cash through a $6 million round that closed in August 2021. True Ventures, Galaxy Interactive and Collab Currency invested alongside existing backers Libertus Capital, Flamingo DAO and The LAO.

The bulk of the capital at Art Blocks’ disposal today, however, comes from the revenue it booked in the bull run. The company takes a 10% fee on primary sales and 2.5% of any secondary transactions, according to its website. A straightforward calculation suggests, therefore, that Art Blocks banked at least $58 million in revenue in the month of August 2021 alone.

“We had a crazy year in 2021,” Calderon said. Naturally, after the $6 million round, bigger backers came knocking.

Calderon said he fielded offers both to invest in Art Blocks and to buy the company outright at valuations in excess of $1 billion. He declined to name the investors.

“Why we didn’t raise more money? Because I thought it would be gross to raise more money when everything was just peak FOMO,” he said. “I’m sitting here thinking, ‘OK yeah, I can see that from the numbers now, but what on earth makes you think that these numbers are going to continue forever?’ It’s completely unreasonable.”

Cost-wise, the operation appears to have stayed fairly lean; Calderon said Art Blocks’ current headcount is 40 people. And as alluded to earlier, Art Blocks does not seem to burn through cash quite so hungrily as the average tech startup. Calderon sees a runway of one to two years as “too low,” mindful of the often-stellar jobs his staff left to join what remains a fairly zany startup.

Carry on canoeing

Keep calm and carry on seems to be the basis of Calderon’s plan for navigating a rough period for crypto firms.

“We’re in a canoe, going down a river that’s moving very fast, with tiny little paddles, and all we can do just from a mental health standpoint is just keep f---ing doing what we’re doing,” he said.

Which is not to say that Art Blocks doesn’t have any new ideas in the works. Calderon speaks enthusiastically about potential use cases for Art Blocks’ on-demand minting technology — at the heart of which is the 1 of 1 of X concept — in other industries, such as fashion or even ceramic tiles. Art Blocks is hoping to position the platform as an “engine partner” for such endeavors, Calderon said.

In October last year, Tyler Hobbs, creator of an Art Blocks’ smash hit collection called Fidenza, made $17 million selling passes that gave buyers a level of control over the look of NFTs minted from his QQL collection. By toying with knobs and dials, pass-holders can manipulate the QQL algorithm to suit their fancy.

Art Blocks is working on new minting mechanics of its own, due next quarter, Calderon said. There will be less of a manual element, however.

Calderon acknowledges that Art Blocks must hit “homeostasis” at some point. To do that, the startup and indeed the industry needs to find ways to access a bigger market.

“Some people are just so focused on extracting every last dollar from every last person in the industry that are here, that they’re not spending any time on thinking, ‘how do I make this thing appealing to the outside world?’ And I think that’s where we could shoot ourselves in the foot as an industry,” Calderon said.  

“If Art Blocks doesn’t make it through this, it’s like the value proposition of the NFT just disappears.”

QUICK TAKE
Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow’s team denies she invested in NFT project called Wild. The company disputes the claim.
Celebrities who once fawned over them have been turning their back on digital assets in the wake of a downturn in the industry and fallout from scandals like FTX’s collapse.
“Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” according to Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain

Two months ago, a little-known NFT startup geared toward helping up-and-coming artists introduced itself to the world. Dubbed Wild, it sported a bevy of business luminaries as backers like founders Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Kevin Lin of Twitch.

But leading the headlines at the time, both in The Block's reporting and elsewhere, was actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The Oscar winner and founder of the multimillion-dollar Goop wellness brand empire was reported at the time to have invested in Wild. Now that's in dispute.

Nearly two months later, a representative of Paltrow’s said over the weekend that it was “completely false” that she invested in Wild, while a spokesperson for Wild later said in a statement that the “initial reporting is correct.”

Paltrow’s team seemingly distancing her from a crypto-related project after the fact — Wild used her name online as far back as March when The Block and others initially reported the actress’s  involvement — is just the latest example in an ongoing parade of once-eager celebrities turning their back on the digital assets industry.

“We’ve obviously seen the implosion of crypto,” said Les Borsai, a veteran of the music industry who co-founded Wave Digital Assets. “We’ve seen the SEC go after celebrities. There’s concern. So it’s not the usual greed mechanism kicking in to say ‘I can go do a crypto thing, or a web3 thing, without consequence.’ Their representation is not stupid.”

Fallon, Damon and FTX boosters

Last year “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon stopped using a Bored Ape NFT as his avatar on Twitter and the market began to sour. Actor Matt Damon said he took money to do a Crypto.com advertisement because he needed money for his nonprofit that helps people access clean water and sanitation. Shaquille O’Neal said he was ""just a paid spokesperson"" for FTX – and is facing a class-action suit – for his decision to promote the now disgraced crypto trading platform.

Although it comes weeks after the news of Paltrow’s now disputed investment was made public, Paltrow’s team was stern in their denial, repeating it three times by email.

“We were alerted to the story on Gwyneth Paltrow backing web3 art platform Wild,” Goop EVP Noora Raj Brown said in her first email denying her boss’s involvement, sent last Saturday. “This story is completely false and Gwyneth is not an investor in the platform.” 

The Block corrected its early March story based upon Brown’s email, stripping it of any mention of Paltrow. At the original time of publishing, Wild founder and Chief Executive J. Douglass Kobs told The Block in a written interview that Paltrow had invested in the web3 company alongside Matrix Partners, LinkedIn's Hoffman and Twitch's Lin.

Wild's CEO says he met Paltrow at a leadership summit

In the March story about Wild, Kobs said that he and Paltrow became friends after meeting at a leadership summit in 2021, adding that she's an ""early adopter"" of web3 and NFTs. The crypto news outlet Decrypt also reported the news of Paltrow's involvement, as did CoinDesk. Evidence of Paltrow’s disputed involvement also exists elsewhere online, including a link to Wild's original announcement accessible from OpenSea, a premiere NFT marketplace.

It is not unheard of for projects to announce a slate of backers only to have some publicly refute any such involvement. Just this week, Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek issued a statement denying it had invested in a crypto startup named Array. Last month, no less than four supposed backers of the fledgling OPNX exchange said they weren’t investors after the startup had claimed they were.

Celebrity advisors have for months been trying to help their clients avoid getting mixed up in an industry still going through serious growing pains and intense regulatory and political scrutiny.

Months ago, ​one top Hollywood agent told The Block his firm was spending a significant amount of time advising clients against promoting crypto-related projects. “You don’t want to go and do something that is going to jeopardize your credibility in the space,” they said at the time.

Not enough marketing dollars

The current trend of fewer celebrity endorsements of crypto projects is also being driven by companies having less money to spend on marketing, said Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain.

Speaking from personal experience, Georgiades said he had multiple discussions with celebrities enthusiastic about working on a NFT project only to have them later retract “any interest in getting involved” when they felt they were not being properly compensated. Even if he didn’t take the news well, he understands their perspective. “Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” he said.

Borsai, who is passionate about creating a new paradigm with web3 that will redefine the rights celebrities and influencers possess in terms of monetizing the content they create and their reach, said he dreams of a world where the crypto endorsements of the past are not repeated.   

“I don’t believe we should live in a culture where we pay Kim Kardashian $2 million dollars to speak about something she doesn’t understand,” said Borsai. “That’s why she got in trouble with the SEC. I would never use anyone like Kim Kardashian.”

Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax on Instagram and then the SEC penalized her, forcing her to pay $1.26 million, the regulatory agency said last year.

QUICK TAKE
Coinbase EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than estimates of negative $36 million. 
Interest income rose to $240 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC.
Coinbase is ‘fully prepared’ to face off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it says.

Coinbase reported first-quarter revenue up 22% as cost-cutting measures paid dividends. Shares popped 7% in after-hours trading.

Interest income rose 32% to $240 million, above estimates of $205 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC. In the fourth quarter, interest income totaled $182 million, of which $146 million was USDC.

The cryptocurrency exchange said revenue for the first quarter was $736 million, coming in above the $658 million estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than the negative $36 million estimated. 

Subscription and services helped drive this growth, said the firm's vice president of investor relations, Anil Gupta, in an interview with The Block following the release. Subscription and services revenue, which included staking and interest income, was $362 million, above estimates of $316 million. 

The declining circulating supply of USDC may have a more outsized impact on Coinbase's revenue as the year progresses, Mizuho's Ryan Coyne told The Block ahead of time. Gupta confirmed the exchange expects interest income derived from USDC to fall in the second quarter due to this.

Staking accounted for $73.7 million, above the $71 million estimated by FactSet. It did, however, lead to an increase in transaction expenses as rewards are paid out to users, the firm noted. Staking was under the microscope during the first quarter. Kraken reached a $30 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in Coinbase tumbled as the SEC came down on staking as staking revenues came under threat.

Trading volume was flat quarter on quarter, marking the first time since the crypto winter began the exchange's quarterly volume did not decline. Monthly transacting users climbed modestly to 8.4 million from 8.3 million.
 
Coinbase ‘fully prepared' to fight the SEC

Coinbase also provided shareholders with an update on its looming legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a key U.S. regulator. The SEC gave Coinbase official notice that it was the subject of an investigation last month with a Wells Notice, a document that can precede an enforcement action.

The company responded to the notice last week, warning that an enforcement action against Coinbase would not be in the country’s interest. Separately, Coinbase is suing the SEC to answer its request for a digital asset-specific rule.

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the SEC, they have not shared their specific concerns with Coinbase or provided any clarity or workable path forward for the industry. While we hope to avoid litigation, we are fully prepared to defend ourselves and advocate for the entire crypto industry if necessary,” Coinbase wrote in its shareholder letter.

Coinbase said its “preferred path would be for Congress to take action to provide clear rules of the road for the industry.” The exchange hinted that “real action” could be taken on “substantive, bipartisan legislation” during the second quarter of 2023, which ends in June.

“We are also digging in on our direct advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. We need crypto-specific rules and regulation, not more enforcement, to help this innovative technology flourish and for America to maintain its leadership position,” the letter said.

Block sold $2.2 billion in bitcoin in Q1 2023 via Cash App.
That figure represents a 25% year-over-year increase, according to Block’s quarterly results. 

Block, formerly known as Square, reported surging sales of bitcoin on its Cash App platform in the first quarter of the year. 

In an earnings release on Thursday, the company said it sold $2.2 billion worth of bitcoin in the quarter, a 25% year-over-year increase. That's also an increase from $1.8 billion sold in the fourth quarter of last year.

Gross profits from bitcoin sales were $50 million, according to the Q1 shareholder letter. 

""The year-over-year increase in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of bitcoin compared to the prior-year period,"" Block said.

Block profits rise

Block reported an overall gross profit of $1.7 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase, with total revenue of just under $5 billion in the period.

Voyager Digital is preparing to liquidate after its deal to sell assets to Binance.US fell apart.
The bankrupt lender could start making distributions “within the next few weeks.”

Bankrupt lender Voyager Digital could start distributing cash and crypto to creditors “within the next few weeks,” according to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the troubled crypto lender’s bankruptcy case.

The firm is finalizing the liquidation procedures after crypto exchange Binance.US pulled out of a $1.3 billion deal to buy its assets.

“Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors,” the creditors committee said on Twitter. ""We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.

The court-approved restructuring plan had included a “toggle” that allowed Voyager to liquidate if Binance.US decided to exit the deal. The crypto exchange said it backed away from the plan due to the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

The failed deal between Voyager and Binance.US was met with government scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in a court hearing that staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the country, although the commission hasn’t taken an official position.

Voyager bankruptcy asset recovery

Voyager must first file the liquidation procedures in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and parties will then have 10 days to object to the plan. The company said it had more than 100,000 creditors when it filed for bankruptcy protection last summer.

“If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go ‘effective’ with the plan at that time,” the committee said."" If an objection is filed, the Court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go effective.""

Of the 6% of creditors who voted on the proposed Voyager restructuring plan, 97% voted in favor. Customers would have seen a 73% recovery of assets under the Binance.US proposal, although that percentage could have dropped to 48% if claims from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sibling Alameda Research are eventually successful.

With Star Wars NFTs, Disney takes one step closer into the world of crypto.
The digital toys will cost $39.99.

With wannabe Jedis rattling their lightsabers around the world in honor of Thursday's Star Wars Day celebrations, Cryptoys has announced it will be selling — in partnership with Disney — digital toys fashioned after three of the movie franchises' most iconic characters.

Cryptoys, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Mattel and Dapper Labs, said it will release “15 limited-edition Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Darth Vader collectible digital toys.”

Although The Walt Disney Company is one of the most successful marketers and sellers of merchandise based on famous intellectual property, the Hollywood studio and theme park operator has yet to make a big foray into crypto.

Last year, the media conglomerate advertised a job opening for a transaction lawyer to explore emerging technology opportunities, according to a posting on LinkedIn.

Powered by Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, consumers can buy Cryptoys Star Wars NFTs for $39.99. Purchases will be possible with Apple  Pay and Google Pay, “worldwide,” according to the company.

QUICK TAKE
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who’s a possible presidential candidate in next year’s election, alleged there were people that ‘want to get rid of crypto.’
DeSantis said this week that legislation to ban central bank digital currencies in the state is advancing.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the Sunshine state would soon move against any kind of a central bank digital currency, with lawmakers advancing with legislation that could be on his desk within ""the next couple of weeks.""

""Florida rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on May 2. ""You could just get fined, and they'll just take it right out of your digital currency, without any due process or anything like that. And so it gives the government a huge amount of power over your economic self sufficiency and independence.""

The Republican is an avid critic of centrally controlled digital currencies, but he's expressed support in the past for decentralized cryptocurrencies because the government has no control over them.

DeSantis, who's widely considered as a possible presidential candidate in next year's election, has previously accused President Joe Biden of eyeing the technology for “surveillance and control.” He first announced the legislation that would outlaw centralized digital currencies in the state in March. 

His Tuesday comments came amid widespread discussion of what's been perceived by some to be a broad crackdown on the crypto sector by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase, a U.S.-listed crypto exchange, is suing the regulator and calling for clear rules.  

Crypto crackdown

""They want to get rid of crypto,"" DeSantis said. ""They don't like crypto because they can't control crypto, so they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency.""

""My view is is like, if you want to invest in crypto, it's up to you,"" DeSantis continued. ""You can do it. I mean, like, you can make those decisions.""

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

CATARINA MOURA
00:00 / 00:00

DeSantis' press office said in an emailed response to questions that he was referring to ""those such as the Biden Administration."" In the Tuesday remarks, the governor said an agenda was being imposed by an ""elite"" with access to ""to a lot of financial might, a lot of business resources, corporate resources.""

DeSantis said the pending legislation in Florida would provide preemptive protection from a U.S. central bank digital currency, even though one doesn't yet exist.  

DeSantis warns against 'financial surveillance state'

""I don't think Congress would authorize it,"" DeSantis said. ""But if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally, in Florida, we'll have a prohibition against that. And I think that that's ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don't have a financial surveillance state, where they know every transaction that you're making.""

DeSantis first raised his opposition to centralized digital currencies last year, but he has previously taken a friendlier approach toward decentralized tokens and has said he was working on ways for Floridians to pay taxes with crypto.

The Biden administration has developed policy objectives for a possible CBDC system in the U.S., with the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department both conducting research in the area.

(Updates with response from DeSantis press office in eighth paragraph.)

QUICK TAKE
The pepe memecoin climbed past $1 billion in market cap, pushing it into the ranks of the top 50 most valuable crypto tokens. 
Binance announced it would list the token today, while warning that it “has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team.”

Pepe, a crypto token styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon meme, climbed past $1 billion in market cap for the first time as traders pushed it into the top 50 most valuable coins. 

One pepe is currently worth $0.00000279, according to data provider CoinGecko. The token has risen 67% over the past 24 hours and surged more than 10-fold over the past week, making pepe the 45th largest by market value.  

Memecoins — which take a recognisable internet meme and add an element of financial speculation — have a long history in crypto, even if they have zero utility. Naive investors can be drawn into their parabolic gains, which have a habit of crashing suddenly and leaving those who bought near the top nursing huge losses. 

Two dog-themed tokens — dogecoin and shiba inu — have become fixtures in the ranks of the most valuable crypto projects since the pandemic-fueled market action of 2020 and 2021. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has regularly tweeted his appreciation for dogecoin, often with his tongue at least partly in his cheek, and research firms such as Chainalysis have bowed to pressure to cover it. 

""This is the purest representation of crypto’s speculative prowess,"" said Steven Zheng, research director at The Block Research. 

The gains in pepe came as Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, announced it would list the token for the first time. Binance clients will be able to trade pepe from Saturday.  

""Please note that the token has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team,"" Binance warned in its announcement.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added on Twitter, ""Meme coins (and all crypto) are high risk! Remember, no one is forcing you to buy them. [Do your own research] and be responsible for your own actions.""

Pepe volume overtakes dogecoin

For now, at least, pepe appears to have taken the crown as crypto's favorite memecoin. Earlier this week, trading volume for pepe exceeded that for both dogecoin and shiba inu. 

In fact, those trading the token on Uniswap have burned more than $10 million in Ethereum transaction fees — where a portion of the fee is destroyed instead of going to miners — over the last three weeks. This has boosted the amount of ether getting burned on the network, which is now up to around $60 million per week.

Despite the huge paper gains, those looking to cash in by selling might struggle with a lack of liquidity. A Nansen report this week highlighted one pepe early adopter selling $2.2 million of the token but only receiving $650,000 in ether “due to massive slippage.” 

Despite the skepticism, Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, highlighted that renewed interest in memecoins could have wider importance for crypto markets.

""Under the surface, we are starting to see increased activity that the more speculative parts of the crypto industry are awakening after almost a year in hibernation,"" Thielen wrote in a report.

As the artificial intelligence field continues to grow, the initial excitement has to faded and been replaced with fear, distrust, and a general unease. This comes as the media publishes headlines that read “A.I. is ‘one of the biggest risks’ to civilization” and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.

Humans vs Machines

After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.’s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving

cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That’s why augmented intelligence is the future. It’s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production – as it has happened after every technological revolution.

One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator’s own words, is designed “to empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.” Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what’s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. – Augmented Intelligence.

Case Study

The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control – like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human’s hand is continuously on Morgan’s “steering wheel.” The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn’t more parameters, it’s more quality and domain specific training.

MORGAN’s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like

MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower’s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:

This is the epitome of augmented intelligence — humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.

QUICK TAKE
A problematic transaction has caused issues for Bitcoin collectibles project Ordinals.
The transaction upset its inscription numbering system, according to developers discussing the issue.

Ordinals, the system by which digital collectibles are written onto the Bitcoin blockchain, is facing a new challenge after a developer found a way to introduce a bug into the metadata. 

The problem occurred when a developer known as Supertestnet initiated a transaction that didn’t output a satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but was seen as valid in the Ordinals system. As a result, it knocked the numbering system that Ordinals uses for its inscriptions off by one. 

“It shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own, so this is a bug. However, fixing the bug by making [Ordinals] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” said Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on GitHub.

Ordinals provide a way to store NFTs on Bitcoin after network upgrades made it easier and cheaper to store larger amounts of data. Inscriptions are the metadata added to satoshis that may include information as digital entries on Bitcoin's distributed public ledger.

Supertestnet also released a tool and related instructions for anyone else who wants to create the same types of problematic transactions. They illustrated their GitHub post with an image reading ""I am become Supertestnet, destroyer of JPEGs.""

Bitcoin Ordinals not broken yet

The bug isn't a huge problem as it doesn’t break the main Ordinals system of tracking satoshis, which are linked to collectibles, argued Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy. Instead, it refers to inscription numbers, a vanity metric marking the order in which each Ordinal collectible was created.

“This is totally fine,"" Diekroeger said on Twitter. ""In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway.” 

His view was backed by a developer known as Rijndael who said there shouldn’t be any impact on the actual Ordinals themselves, only the inscription numbering system.

Diekroeger also noted that the original transaction contained an inscription that promoted an alternative system for creating collectibles on Bitcoin called Soma.

"As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run","May 5, 2023, 5:00AM EDT ","As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run

QUICK TAKE
Volumes have fallen steeply for Art Blocks, the generative art platform that boomed in the last crypto bull run. 
But founder Erick Calderon remains unwavering on topics such as creator royalties, while dismissing excessive fundraising as “gross.”
“I’m a little bit timid and hesitant… because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

By his own admission, Erick “Snowfro” Calderon is not a typical crypto founder.

Before founding Art Blocks, a marketplace for computer-generated artworks, he spent 20 years running a ceramic tile business. During the last bull market, he claims to have turned down multiple investment offers that would have valued Art Blocks at over $1 billion. He stands firm on the need to uphold creator royalties in the NFT space. And he has resisted the temptation to launch an Art Blocks token.

But most iconoclastic of all, he isn’t convinced there will be another crypto bull run.

“There are people that would accuse us of being not ambitious enough with the amount of funds that we have left,” Calderon, who is also Art Blocks’ CEO, said in an interview. “The reason that I’m a little bit timid and hesitant is because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

Art Blocks is in the business of auctioning off generative art in the form of NFT collections created by algorithms, albeit within parameters set by human artists. The platform was a darling of the 2021 crypto boom. In a single month in August 2021, it sold no less than $587 million worth of NFTs, according to CryptoSlam data.

But times have changed for Art Blocks, much as they have in the wider crypto space. The business recorded just $6.5 million in sales in April, the lowest total since May 2021. Around half the projects listed on the platform today don’t sell out, according to Calderon.

Yet Calderon, who is himself a generative artist, is stubborn. Even as volumes wane, he has stuck to his guns on topics such as creator royalties — despite other marketplaces in the sector deciding to waive them for the benefit of traders. While this and similar strategic choices are costing Art Blocks money in the short-term, Calderon remains optimistic.

“The vibes are negative, but the vision is very resolute,” he said. “I’m just as excited today — I’m maybe more excited today — than I was in 2021 and I just want people to know that.”

Art Blocks' royalties pain

Art Blocks’ stance on royalties — the levy paid to creators on secondary sales of their NFTs — is an apt illustration of how the business has positioned itself.

Blur, the recently launched NFT marketplace targeting pro traders, set its royalty fee at just 0.5% in February. In response, rival OpenSea dropped its 2.5% fee to zero for a limited time.

Art Blocks, which has a secondary market of its own, continues to enforce full royalty fees of 5%. That means collectors must spend more to buy an NFT on Art Blocks than they would for the same NFT on Blur or OpenSea. Inevitably, that has put a dent in revenues.

“Art Blocks has lost a significant amount of income as a result of royalties,” Calderon said, adding that the royalty fees had previously provided the bulk of the firm’s event budgets.

But Calderon thinks artists create higher quality work — in part because it’s less necessary for them to continually produce — and are generally more engaged with their audiences when royalties are upheld. “To me it just seems very straightforward that the ecosystem will be a better place if royalties are respected,” he added.

Blur, Calderon said, is “the antithesis of being about the art,” and is much more focused on market mechanics and traders. “I’m also very frustrated with what’s happening, but if it wasn’t them, it would be somebody else doing it,” Calderon said.

Art Blocks' unicorn snub

Even with revenue down, Art Blocks remains a ""well-capitalized company,” according to Calderon.

The startup may not have raised at a billion-dollar valuation, but it did bring in some cash through a $6 million round that closed in August 2021. True Ventures, Galaxy Interactive and Collab Currency invested alongside existing backers Libertus Capital, Flamingo DAO and The LAO.

The bulk of the capital at Art Blocks’ disposal today, however, comes from the revenue it booked in the bull run. The company takes a 10% fee on primary sales and 2.5% of any secondary transactions, according to its website. A straightforward calculation suggests, therefore, that Art Blocks banked at least $58 million in revenue in the month of August 2021 alone.

“We had a crazy year in 2021,” Calderon said. Naturally, after the $6 million round, bigger backers came knocking.

Calderon said he fielded offers both to invest in Art Blocks and to buy the company outright at valuations in excess of $1 billion. He declined to name the investors.

“Why we didn’t raise more money? Because I thought it would be gross to raise more money when everything was just peak FOMO,” he said. “I’m sitting here thinking, ‘OK yeah, I can see that from the numbers now, but what on earth makes you think that these numbers are going to continue forever?’ It’s completely unreasonable.”

Cost-wise, the operation appears to have stayed fairly lean; Calderon said Art Blocks’ current headcount is 40 people. And as alluded to earlier, Art Blocks does not seem to burn through cash quite so hungrily as the average tech startup. Calderon sees a runway of one to two years as “too low,” mindful of the often-stellar jobs his staff left to join what remains a fairly zany startup.

Carry on canoeing

Keep calm and carry on seems to be the basis of Calderon’s plan for navigating a rough period for crypto firms.

“We’re in a canoe, going down a river that’s moving very fast, with tiny little paddles, and all we can do just from a mental health standpoint is just keep f---ing doing what we’re doing,” he said.

Which is not to say that Art Blocks doesn’t have any new ideas in the works. Calderon speaks enthusiastically about potential use cases for Art Blocks’ on-demand minting technology — at the heart of which is the 1 of 1 of X concept — in other industries, such as fashion or even ceramic tiles. Art Blocks is hoping to position the platform as an “engine partner” for such endeavors, Calderon said.

In October last year, Tyler Hobbs, creator of an Art Blocks’ smash hit collection called Fidenza, made $17 million selling passes that gave buyers a level of control over the look of NFTs minted from his QQL collection. By toying with knobs and dials, pass-holders can manipulate the QQL algorithm to suit their fancy.

Art Blocks is working on new minting mechanics of its own, due next quarter, Calderon said. There will be less of a manual element, however.

Calderon acknowledges that Art Blocks must hit “homeostasis” at some point. To do that, the startup and indeed the industry needs to find ways to access a bigger market.

“Some people are just so focused on extracting every last dollar from every last person in the industry that are here, that they’re not spending any time on thinking, ‘how do I make this thing appealing to the outside world?’ And I think that’s where we could shoot ourselves in the foot as an industry,” Calderon said.  

“If Art Blocks doesn’t make it through this, it’s like the value proposition of the NFT just disappears.”

QUICK TAKE
Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow’s team denies she invested in NFT project called Wild. The company disputes the claim.
Celebrities who once fawned over them have been turning their back on digital assets in the wake of a downturn in the industry and fallout from scandals like FTX’s collapse.
“Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” according to Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain

Two months ago, a little-known NFT startup geared toward helping up-and-coming artists introduced itself to the world. Dubbed Wild, it sported a bevy of business luminaries as backers like founders Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Kevin Lin of Twitch.

But leading the headlines at the time, both in The Block's reporting and elsewhere, was actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The Oscar winner and founder of the multimillion-dollar Goop wellness brand empire was reported at the time to have invested in Wild. Now that's in dispute.

Nearly two months later, a representative of Paltrow’s said over the weekend that it was “completely false” that she invested in Wild, while a spokesperson for Wild later said in a statement that the “initial reporting is correct.”

Paltrow’s team seemingly distancing her from a crypto-related project after the fact — Wild used her name online as far back as March when The Block and others initially reported the actress’s  involvement — is just the latest example in an ongoing parade of once-eager celebrities turning their back on the digital assets industry.

“We’ve obviously seen the implosion of crypto,” said Les Borsai, a veteran of the music industry who co-founded Wave Digital Assets. “We’ve seen the SEC go after celebrities. There’s concern. So it’s not the usual greed mechanism kicking in to say ‘I can go do a crypto thing, or a web3 thing, without consequence.’ Their representation is not stupid.”

Fallon, Damon and FTX boosters

Last year “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon stopped using a Bored Ape NFT as his avatar on Twitter and the market began to sour. Actor Matt Damon said he took money to do a Crypto.com advertisement because he needed money for his nonprofit that helps people access clean water and sanitation. Shaquille O’Neal said he was ""just a paid spokesperson"" for FTX – and is facing a class-action suit – for his decision to promote the now disgraced crypto trading platform.

Although it comes weeks after the news of Paltrow’s now disputed investment was made public, Paltrow’s team was stern in their denial, repeating it three times by email.

“We were alerted to the story on Gwyneth Paltrow backing web3 art platform Wild,” Goop EVP Noora Raj Brown said in her first email denying her boss’s involvement, sent last Saturday. “This story is completely false and Gwyneth is not an investor in the platform.” 

The Block corrected its early March story based upon Brown’s email, stripping it of any mention of Paltrow. At the original time of publishing, Wild founder and Chief Executive J. Douglass Kobs told The Block in a written interview that Paltrow had invested in the web3 company alongside Matrix Partners, LinkedIn's Hoffman and Twitch's Lin.

Wild's CEO says he met Paltrow at a leadership summit

In the March story about Wild, Kobs said that he and Paltrow became friends after meeting at a leadership summit in 2021, adding that she's an ""early adopter"" of web3 and NFTs. The crypto news outlet Decrypt also reported the news of Paltrow's involvement, as did CoinDesk. Evidence of Paltrow’s disputed involvement also exists elsewhere online, including a link to Wild's original announcement accessible from OpenSea, a premiere NFT marketplace.

It is not unheard of for projects to announce a slate of backers only to have some publicly refute any such involvement. Just this week, Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek issued a statement denying it had invested in a crypto startup named Array. Last month, no less than four supposed backers of the fledgling OPNX exchange said they weren’t investors after the startup had claimed they were.

Celebrity advisors have for months been trying to help their clients avoid getting mixed up in an industry still going through serious growing pains and intense regulatory and political scrutiny.

Months ago, ​one top Hollywood agent told The Block his firm was spending a significant amount of time advising clients against promoting crypto-related projects. “You don’t want to go and do something that is going to jeopardize your credibility in the space,” they said at the time.

Not enough marketing dollars

The current trend of fewer celebrity endorsements of crypto projects is also being driven by companies having less money to spend on marketing, said Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain.

Speaking from personal experience, Georgiades said he had multiple discussions with celebrities enthusiastic about working on a NFT project only to have them later retract “any interest in getting involved” when they felt they were not being properly compensated. Even if he didn’t take the news well, he understands their perspective. “Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” he said.

Borsai, who is passionate about creating a new paradigm with web3 that will redefine the rights celebrities and influencers possess in terms of monetizing the content they create and their reach, said he dreams of a world where the crypto endorsements of the past are not repeated.   

“I don’t believe we should live in a culture where we pay Kim Kardashian $2 million dollars to speak about something she doesn’t understand,” said Borsai. “That’s why she got in trouble with the SEC. I would never use anyone like Kim Kardashian.”

Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax on Instagram and then the SEC penalized her, forcing her to pay $1.26 million, the regulatory agency said last year.

Coinbase EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than estimates of negative $36 million. 
Interest income rose to $240 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC.
Coinbase is ‘fully prepared’ to face off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it says.

Coinbase reported first-quarter revenue up 22% as cost-cutting measures paid dividends. Shares popped 7% in after-hours trading.

Interest income rose 32% to $240 million, above estimates of $205 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC. In the fourth quarter, interest income totaled $182 million, of which $146 million was USDC.

The cryptocurrency exchange said revenue for the first quarter was $736 million, coming in above the $658 million estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than the negative $36 million estimated. 

Subscription and services helped drive this growth, said the firm's vice president of investor relations, Anil Gupta, in an interview with The Block following the release. Subscription and services revenue, which included staking and interest income, was $362 million, above estimates of $316 million. 

The declining circulating supply of USDC may have a more outsized impact on Coinbase's revenue as the year progresses, Mizuho's Ryan Coyne told The Block ahead of time. Gupta confirmed the exchange expects interest income derived from USDC to fall in the second quarter due to this.

Staking accounted for $73.7 million, above the $71 million estimated by FactSet. It did, however, lead to an increase in transaction expenses as rewards are paid out to users, the firm noted. Staking was under the microscope during the first quarter. Kraken reached a $30 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in Coinbase tumbled as the SEC came down on staking as staking revenues came under threat.

Trading volume was flat quarter on quarter, marking the first time since the crypto winter began the exchange's quarterly volume did not decline. Monthly transacting users climbed modestly to 8.4 million from 8.3 million.
 
Coinbase ‘fully prepared' to fight the SEC

Coinbase also provided shareholders with an update on its looming legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a key U.S. regulator. The SEC gave Coinbase official notice that it was the subject of an investigation last month with a Wells Notice, a document that can precede an enforcement action.

The company responded to the notice last week, warning that an enforcement action against Coinbase would not be in the country’s interest. Separately, Coinbase is suing the SEC to answer its request for a digital asset-specific rule.

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the SEC, they have not shared their specific concerns with Coinbase or provided any clarity or workable path forward for the industry. While we hope to avoid litigation, we are fully prepared to defend ourselves and advocate for the entire crypto industry if necessary,” Coinbase wrote in its shareholder letter.

Coinbase said its “preferred path would be for Congress to take action to provide clear rules of the road for the industry.” The exchange hinted that “real action” could be taken on “substantive, bipartisan legislation” during the second quarter of 2023, which ends in June.

“We are also digging in on our direct advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. We need crypto-specific rules and regulation, not more enforcement, to help this innovative technology flourish and for America to maintain its leadership position,” the letter said.

Block sold $2.2 billion in bitcoin in Q1 2023 via Cash App.
That figure represents a 25% year-over-year increase, according to Block’s quarterly results. 

Block, formerly known as Square, reported surging sales of bitcoin on its Cash App platform in the first quarter of the year. 

In an earnings release on Thursday, the company said it sold $2.2 billion worth of bitcoin in the quarter, a 25% year-over-year increase. That's also an increase from $1.8 billion sold in the fourth quarter of last year.

Gross profits from bitcoin sales were $50 million, according to the Q1 shareholder letter. 

""The year-over-year increase in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of bitcoin compared to the prior-year period,"" Block said.

Voyager Digital is preparing to liquidate after its deal to sell assets to Binance.US fell apart.
The bankrupt lender could start making distributions “within the next few weeks.”

Bankrupt lender Voyager Digital could start distributing cash and crypto to creditors “within the next few weeks,” according to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the troubled crypto lender’s bankruptcy case.

The firm is finalizing the liquidation procedures after crypto exchange Binance.US pulled out of a $1.3 billion deal to buy its assets.

“Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors,” the creditors committee said on Twitter. ""We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.

The court-approved restructuring plan had included a “toggle” that allowed Voyager to liquidate if Binance.US decided to exit the deal. The crypto exchange said it backed away from the plan due to the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

The failed deal between Voyager and Binance.US was met with government scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in a court hearing that staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the country, although the commission hasn’t taken an official position.

Voyager bankruptcy asset recovery

Voyager must first file the liquidation procedures in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and parties will then have 10 days to object to the plan. The company said it had more than 100,000 creditors when it filed for bankruptcy protection last summer.

“If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go ‘effective’ with the plan at that time,” the committee said."" If an objection is filed, the Court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go effective.""

Of the 6% of creditors who voted on the proposed Voyager restructuring plan, 97% voted in favor. Customers would have seen a 73% recovery of assets under the Binance.US proposal, although that percentage could have dropped to 48% if claims from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sibling Alameda Research are eventually successful.

With Star Wars NFTs, Disney takes one step closer into the world of crypto.
The digital toys will cost $39.99.

With wannabe Jedis rattling their lightsabers around the world in honor of Thursday's Star Wars Day celebrations, Cryptoys has announced it will be selling — in partnership with Disney — digital toys fashioned after three of the movie franchises' most iconic characters.

Cryptoys, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Mattel and Dapper Labs, said it will release “15 limited-edition Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Darth Vader collectible digital toys.”

Although The Walt Disney Company is one of the most successful marketers and sellers of merchandise based on famous intellectual property, the Hollywood studio and theme park operator has yet to make a big foray into crypto.

Last year, the media conglomerate advertised a job opening for a transaction lawyer to explore emerging technology opportunities, according to a posting on LinkedIn.

Powered by Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, consumers can buy Cryptoys Star Wars NFTs for $39.99. Purchases will be possible with Apple  Pay and Google Pay, “worldwide,” according to the company.

QUICK TAKE
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who’s a possible presidential candidate in next year’s election, alleged there were people that ‘want to get rid of crypto.’
DeSantis said this week that legislation to ban central bank digital currencies in the state is advancing.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the Sunshine state would soon move against any kind of a central bank digital currency, with lawmakers advancing with legislation that could be on his desk within ""the next couple of weeks.""

""Florida rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on May 2. ""You could just get fined, and they'll just take it right out of your digital currency, without any due process or anything like that. And so it gives the government a huge amount of power over your economic self sufficiency and independence.""

The Republican is an avid critic of centrally controlled digital currencies, but he's expressed support in the past for decentralized cryptocurrencies because the government has no control over them.

DeSantis, who's widely considered as a possible presidential candidate in next year's election, has previously accused President Joe Biden of eyeing the technology for “surveillance and control.” He first announced the legislation that would outlaw centralized digital currencies in the state in March. 

His Tuesday comments came amid widespread discussion of what's been perceived by some to be a broad crackdown on the crypto sector by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase, a U.S.-listed crypto exchange, is suing the regulator and calling for clear rules.  

Crypto crackdown

""They want to get rid of crypto,"" DeSantis said. ""They don't like crypto because they can't control crypto, so they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency.""

""My view is is like, if you want to invest in crypto, it's up to you,"" DeSantis continued. ""You can do it. I mean, like, you can make those decisions.""

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

00:00 / 00:00

DeSantis' press office said in an emailed response to questions that he was referring to ""those such as the Biden Administration."" In the Tuesday remarks, the governor said an agenda was being imposed by an ""elite"" with access to ""to a lot of financial might, a lot of business resources, corporate resources.""

DeSantis said the pending legislation in Florida would provide preemptive protection from a U.S. central bank digital currency, even though one doesn't yet exist.  

DeSantis warns against 'financial surveillance state'

""I don't think Congress would authorize it,"" DeSantis said. ""But if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally, in Florida, we'll have a prohibition against that. And I think that that's ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don't have a financial surveillance state, where they know every transaction that you're making.""

DeSantis first raised his opposition to centralized digital currencies last year, but he has previously taken a friendlier approach toward decentralized tokens and has said he was working on ways for Floridians to pay taxes with crypto.

The Biden administration has developed policy objectives for a possible CBDC system in the U.S., with the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department both conducting research in the area.

The pepe memecoin climbed past $1 billion in market cap, pushing it into the ranks of the top 50 most valuable crypto tokens. 
Binance announced it would list the token today, while warning that it “has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team.”

Pepe, a crypto token styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon meme, climbed past $1 billion in market cap for the first time as traders pushed it into the top 50 most valuable coins. 

One pepe is currently worth $0.00000279, according to data provider CoinGecko. The token has risen 67% over the past 24 hours and surged more than 10-fold over the past week, making pepe the 45th largest by market value.  

Memecoins — which take a recognisable internet meme and add an element of financial speculation — have a long history in crypto, even if they have zero utility. Naive investors can be drawn into their parabolic gains, which have a habit of crashing suddenly and leaving those who bought near the top nursing huge losses. 

Two dog-themed tokens — dogecoin and shiba inu — have become fixtures in the ranks of the most valuable crypto projects since the pandemic-fueled market action of 2020 and 2021. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has regularly tweeted his appreciation for dogecoin, often with his tongue at least partly in his cheek, and research firms such as Chainalysis have bowed to pressure to cover it. 

""This is the purest representation of crypto’s speculative prowess,"" said Steven Zheng, research director at The Block Research. 

The gains in pepe came as Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, announced it would list the token for the first time. Binance clients will be able to trade pepe from Saturday.  

""Please note that the token has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team,"" Binance warned in its announcement.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added on Twitter, ""Meme coins (and all crypto) are high risk! Remember, no one is forcing you to buy them. [Do your own research] and be responsible for your own actions.""

Pepe volume overtakes dogecoin

For now, at least, pepe appears to have taken the crown as crypto's favorite memecoin. Earlier this week, trading volume for pepe exceeded that for both dogecoin and shiba inu. 

In fact, those trading the token on Uniswap have burned more than $10 million in Ethereum transaction fees — where a portion of the fee is destroyed instead of going to miners — over the last three weeks. This has boosted the amount of ether getting burned on the network, which is now up to around $60 million per week.

Despite the huge paper gains, those looking to cash in by selling might struggle with a lack of liquidity. A Nansen report this week highlighted one pepe early adopter selling $2.2 million of the token but only receiving $650,000 in ether “due to massive slippage.” 

Despite the skepticism, Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, highlighted that renewed interest in memecoins could have wider importance for crypto markets.

""Under the surface, we are starting to see increased activity that the more speculative parts of the crypto industry are awakening after almost a year in hibernation,"" Thielen wrote in a report.

As the artificial intelligence field continues to grow, the initial excitement has to faded and been replaced with fear, distrust, and a general unease. This comes as the media publishes headlines that read “A.I. is ‘one of the biggest risks’ to civilization” and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.

Humans vs Machines

After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.’s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving

cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That’s why augmented intelligence is the future. It’s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production – as it has happened after every technological revolution.

One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator’s own words, is designed “to empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.” Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what’s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. – Augmented Intelligence.

Case Study

The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control – like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human’s hand is continuously on Morgan’s “steering wheel.” The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn’t more parameters, it’s more quality and domain specific training.

MORGAN’s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like

MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower’s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:

This is the epitome of augmented intelligence — humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.

"Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering","May 5, 2023, 6:26AM EDT ","Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering

QUICK TAKE
A problematic transaction has caused issues for Bitcoin collectibles project Ordinals.
The transaction upset its inscription numbering system, according to developers discussing the issue.

Ordinals, the system by which digital collectibles are written onto the Bitcoin blockchain, is facing a new challenge after a developer found a way to introduce a bug into the metadata. 

The problem occurred when a developer known as Supertestnet initiated a transaction that didn’t output a satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but was seen as valid in the Ordinals system. As a result, it knocked the numbering system that Ordinals uses for its inscriptions off by one. 

“It shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own, so this is a bug. However, fixing the bug by making [Ordinals] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” said Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on GitHub.

Ordinals provide a way to store NFTs on Bitcoin after network upgrades made it easier and cheaper to store larger amounts of data. Inscriptions are the metadata added to satoshis that may include information as digital entries on Bitcoin's distributed public ledger.

Supertestnet also released a tool and related instructions for anyone else who wants to create the same types of problematic transactions. They illustrated their GitHub post with an image reading ""I am become Supertestnet, destroyer of JPEGs.""

 

Source: GitHub

Bitcoin Ordinals not broken yet

The bug isn't a huge problem as it doesn’t break the main Ordinals system of tracking satoshis, which are linked to collectibles, argued Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy. Instead, it refers to inscription numbers, a vanity metric marking the order in which each Ordinal collectible was created.

“This is totally fine,"" Diekroeger said on Twitter. ""In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway.” 

His view was backed by a developer known as Rijndael who said there shouldn’t be any impact on the actual Ordinals themselves, only the inscription numbering system.

Diekroeger also noted that the original transaction contained an inscription that promoted an alternative system for creating collectibles on Bitcoin called Soma.

"As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run","May 5, 2023, 5:00AM EDT ","As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run

QUICK TAKE
Volumes have fallen steeply for Art Blocks, the generative art platform that boomed in the last crypto bull run. 
But founder Erick Calderon remains unwavering on topics such as creator royalties, while dismissing excessive fundraising as “gross.”
“I’m a little bit timid and hesitant… because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

By his own admission, Erick “Snowfro” Calderon is not a typical crypto founder.

Before founding Art Blocks, a marketplace for computer-generated artworks, he spent 20 years running a ceramic tile business. During the last bull market, he claims to have turned down multiple investment offers that would have valued Art Blocks at over $1 billion. He stands firm on the need to uphold creator royalties in the NFT space. And he has resisted the temptation to launch an Art Blocks token.

But most iconoclastic of all, he isn’t convinced there will be another crypto bull run.

“There are people that would accuse us of being not ambitious enough with the amount of funds that we have left,” Calderon, who is also Art Blocks’ CEO, said in an interview. “The reason that I’m a little bit timid and hesitant is because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

Art Blocks is in the business of auctioning off generative art in the form of NFT collections created by algorithms, albeit within parameters set by human artists. The platform was a darling of the 2021 crypto boom. In a single month in August 2021, it sold no less than $587 million worth of NFTs, according to CryptoSlam data.

But times have changed for Art Blocks, much as they have in the wider crypto space. The business recorded just $6.5 million in sales in April, the lowest total since May 2021. Around half the projects listed on the platform today don’t sell out, according to Calderon.

Yet Calderon, who is himself a generative artist, is stubborn. Even as volumes wane, he has stuck to his guns on topics such as creator royalties — despite other marketplaces in the sector deciding to waive them for the benefit of traders. While this and similar strategic choices are costing Art Blocks money in the short-term, Calderon remains optimistic.

“The vibes are negative, but the vision is very resolute,” he said. “I’m just as excited today — I’m maybe more excited today — than I was in 2021 and I just want people to know that.”

Art Blocks' royalties pain

Art Blocks’ stance on royalties — the levy paid to creators on secondary sales of their NFTs — is an apt illustration of how the business has positioned itself.

Blur, the recently launched NFT marketplace targeting pro traders, set its royalty fee at just 0.5% in February. In response, rival OpenSea dropped its 2.5% fee to zero for a limited time.

Art Blocks, which has a secondary market of its own, continues to enforce full royalty fees of 5%. That means collectors must spend more to buy an NFT on Art Blocks than they would for the same NFT on Blur or OpenSea. Inevitably, that has put a dent in revenues.

“Art Blocks has lost a significant amount of income as a result of royalties,” Calderon said, adding that the royalty fees had previously provided the bulk of the firm’s event budgets.

But Calderon thinks artists create higher quality work — in part because it’s less necessary for them to continually produce — and are generally more engaged with their audiences when royalties are upheld. “To me it just seems very straightforward that the ecosystem will be a better place if royalties are respected,” he added.

Blur, Calderon said, is “the antithesis of being about the art,” and is much more focused on market mechanics and traders. “I’m also very frustrated with what’s happening, but if it wasn’t them, it would be somebody else doing it,” Calderon said.

Art Blocks' unicorn snub

Even with revenue down, Art Blocks remains a ""well-capitalized company,” according to Calderon.

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

CATARINA MOURA
00:00 / 00:00

The startup may not have raised at a billion-dollar valuation, but it did bring in some cash through a $6 million round that closed in August 2021. True Ventures, Galaxy Interactive and Collab Currency invested alongside existing backers Libertus Capital, Flamingo DAO and The LAO.

The bulk of the capital at Art Blocks’ disposal today, however, comes from the revenue it booked in the bull run. The company takes a 10% fee on primary sales and 2.5% of any secondary transactions, according to its website. A straightforward calculation suggests, therefore, that Art Blocks banked at least $58 million in revenue in the month of August 2021 alone.

“We had a crazy year in 2021,” Calderon said. Naturally, after the $6 million round, bigger backers came knocking.

Calderon said he fielded offers both to invest in Art Blocks and to buy the company outright at valuations in excess of $1 billion. He declined to name the investors.

“Why we didn’t raise more money? Because I thought it would be gross to raise more money when everything was just peak FOMO,” he said. “I’m sitting here thinking, ‘OK yeah, I can see that from the numbers now, but what on earth makes you think that these numbers are going to continue forever?’ It’s completely unreasonable.”

Cost-wise, the operation appears to have stayed fairly lean; Calderon said Art Blocks’ current headcount is 40 people. And as alluded to earlier, Art Blocks does not seem to burn through cash quite so hungrily as the average tech startup. Calderon sees a runway of one to two years as “too low,” mindful of the often-stellar jobs his staff left to join what remains a fairly zany startup.

Carry on canoeing

Keep calm and carry on seems to be the basis of Calderon’s plan for navigating a rough period for crypto firms.

“We’re in a canoe, going down a river that’s moving very fast, with tiny little paddles, and all we can do just from a mental health standpoint is just keep f---ing doing what we’re doing,” he said.

Which is not to say that Art Blocks doesn’t have any new ideas in the works. Calderon speaks enthusiastically about potential use cases for Art Blocks’ on-demand minting technology — at the heart of which is the 1 of 1 of X concept — in other industries, such as fashion or even ceramic tiles. Art Blocks is hoping to position the platform as an “engine partner” for such endeavors, Calderon said.

In October last year, Tyler Hobbs, creator of an Art Blocks’ smash hit collection called Fidenza, made $17 million selling passes that gave buyers a level of control over the look of NFTs minted from his QQL collection. By toying with knobs and dials, pass-holders can manipulate the QQL algorithm to suit their fancy.

Art Blocks is working on new minting mechanics of its own, due next quarter, Calderon said. There will be less of a manual element, however.

Calderon acknowledges that Art Blocks must hit “homeostasis” at some point. To do that, the startup and indeed the industry needs to find ways to access a bigger market.

“Some people are just so focused on extracting every last dollar from every last person in the industry that are here, that they’re not spending any time on thinking, ‘how do I make this thing appealing to the outside world?’ And I think that’s where we could shoot ourselves in the foot as an industry,” Calderon said.  

“If Art Blocks doesn’t make it through this, it’s like the value proposition of the NFT just disappears.”

QUICK TAKE
Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow’s team denies she invested in NFT project called Wild. The company disputes the claim.
Celebrities who once fawned over them have been turning their back on digital assets in the wake of a downturn in the industry and fallout from scandals like FTX’s collapse.
“Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” according to Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain

Two months ago, a little-known NFT startup geared toward helping up-and-coming artists introduced itself to the world. Dubbed Wild, it sported a bevy of business luminaries as backers like founders Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Kevin Lin of Twitch.

But leading the headlines at the time, both in The Block's reporting and elsewhere, was actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The Oscar winner and founder of the multimillion-dollar Goop wellness brand empire was reported at the time to have invested in Wild. Now that's in dispute.

Nearly two months later, a representative of Paltrow’s said over the weekend that it was “completely false” that she invested in Wild, while a spokesperson for Wild later said in a statement that the “initial reporting is correct.”

Paltrow’s team seemingly distancing her from a crypto-related project after the fact — Wild used her name online as far back as March when The Block and others initially reported the actress’s  involvement — is just the latest example in an ongoing parade of once-eager celebrities turning their back on the digital assets industry.

“We’ve obviously seen the implosion of crypto,” said Les Borsai, a veteran of the music industry who co-founded Wave Digital Assets. “We’ve seen the SEC go after celebrities. There’s concern. So it’s not the usual greed mechanism kicking in to say ‘I can go do a crypto thing, or a web3 thing, without consequence.’ Their representation is not stupid.”

Fallon, Damon and FTX boosters

Last year “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon stopped using a Bored Ape NFT as his avatar on Twitter and the market began to sour. Actor Matt Damon said he took money to do a Crypto.com advertisement because he needed money for his nonprofit that helps people access clean water and sanitation. Shaquille O’Neal said he was ""just a paid spokesperson"" for FTX – and is facing a class-action suit – for his decision to promote the now disgraced crypto trading platform.

Although it comes weeks after the news of Paltrow’s now disputed investment was made public, Paltrow’s team was stern in their denial, repeating it three times by email.

“We were alerted to the story on Gwyneth Paltrow backing web3 art platform Wild,” Goop EVP Noora Raj Brown said in her first email denying her boss’s involvement, sent last Saturday. “This story is completely false and Gwyneth is not an investor in the platform.” 

The Block corrected its early March story based upon Brown’s email, stripping it of any mention of Paltrow. At the original time of publishing, Wild founder and Chief Executive J. Douglass Kobs told The Block in a written interview that Paltrow had invested in the web3 company alongside Matrix Partners, LinkedIn's Hoffman and Twitch's Lin.

Wild's CEO says he met Paltrow at a leadership summit

In the March story about Wild, Kobs said that he and Paltrow became friends after meeting at a leadership summit in 2021, adding that she's an ""early adopter"" of web3 and NFTs. The crypto news outlet Decrypt also reported the news of Paltrow's involvement, as did CoinDesk. Evidence of Paltrow’s disputed involvement also exists elsewhere online, including a link to Wild's original announcement accessible from OpenSea, a premiere NFT marketplace.

It is not unheard of for projects to announce a slate of backers only to have some publicly refute any such involvement. Just this week, Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek issued a statement denying it had invested in a crypto startup named Array. Last month, no less than four supposed backers of the fledgling OPNX exchange said they weren’t investors after the startup had claimed they were.

Celebrity advisors have for months been trying to help their clients avoid getting mixed up in an industry still going through serious growing pains and intense regulatory and political scrutiny.

Months ago, ​one top Hollywood agent told The Block his firm was spending a significant amount of time advising clients against promoting crypto-related projects. “You don’t want to go and do something that is going to jeopardize your credibility in the space,” they said at the time.

Not enough marketing dollars

The current trend of fewer celebrity endorsements of crypto projects is also being driven by companies having less money to spend on marketing, said Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain.

Speaking from personal experience, Georgiades said he had multiple discussions with celebrities enthusiastic about working on a NFT project only to have them later retract “any interest in getting involved” when they felt they were not being properly compensated. Even if he didn’t take the news well, he understands their perspective. “Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” he said.

Borsai, who is passionate about creating a new paradigm with web3 that will redefine the rights celebrities and influencers possess in terms of monetizing the content they create and their reach, said he dreams of a world where the crypto endorsements of the past are not repeated.   

“I don’t believe we should live in a culture where we pay Kim Kardashian $2 million dollars to speak about something she doesn’t understand,” said Borsai. “That’s why she got in trouble with the SEC. I would never use anyone like Kim Kardashian.”

Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax on Instagram and then the SEC penalized her, forcing her to pay $1.26 million, the regulatory agency said last year.

Coinbase EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than estimates of negative $36 million. 
Interest income rose to $240 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC.
Coinbase is ‘fully prepared’ to face off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it says.

Coinbase reported first-quarter revenue up 22% as cost-cutting measures paid dividends. Shares popped 7% in after-hours trading.

Interest income rose 32% to $240 million, above estimates of $205 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC. In the fourth quarter, interest income totaled $182 million, of which $146 million was USDC.

The cryptocurrency exchange said revenue for the first quarter was $736 million, coming in above the $658 million estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than the negative $36 million estimated. 

Subscription and services helped drive this growth, said the firm's vice president of investor relations, Anil Gupta, in an interview with The Block following the release. Subscription and services revenue, which included staking and interest income, was $362 million, above estimates of $316 million. 

The declining circulating supply of USDC may have a more outsized impact on Coinbase's revenue as the year progresses, Mizuho's Ryan Coyne told The Block ahead of time. Gupta confirmed the exchange expects interest income derived from USDC to fall in the second quarter due to this.

Staking accounted for $73.7 million, above the $71 million estimated by FactSet. It did, however, lead to an increase in transaction expenses as rewards are paid out to users, the firm noted. Staking was under the microscope during the first quarter. Kraken reached a $30 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in Coinbase tumbled as the SEC came down on staking as staking revenues came under threat.

Trading volume was flat quarter on quarter, marking the first time since the crypto winter began the exchange's quarterly volume did not decline. Monthly transacting users climbed modestly to 8.4 million from 8.3 million.
 
Coinbase ‘fully prepared' to fight the SEC

Coinbase also provided shareholders with an update on its looming legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a key U.S. regulator. The SEC gave Coinbase official notice that it was the subject of an investigation last month with a Wells Notice, a document that can precede an enforcement action.

The company responded to the notice last week, warning that an enforcement action against Coinbase would not be in the country’s interest. Separately, Coinbase is suing the SEC to answer its request for a digital asset-specific rule.

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the SEC, they have not shared their specific concerns with Coinbase or provided any clarity or workable path forward for the industry. While we hope to avoid litigation, we are fully prepared to defend ourselves and advocate for the entire crypto industry if necessary,” Coinbase wrote in its shareholder letter.

Coinbase said its “preferred path would be for Congress to take action to provide clear rules of the road for the industry.” The exchange hinted that “real action” could be taken on “substantive, bipartisan legislation” during the second quarter of 2023, which ends in June.

“We are also digging in on our direct advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. We need crypto-specific rules and regulation, not more enforcement, to help this innovative technology flourish and for America to maintain its leadership position,” the letter said.

Block sold $2.2 billion in bitcoin in Q1 2023 via Cash App.
That figure represents a 25% year-over-year increase, according to Block’s quarterly results. 

Block, formerly known as Square, reported surging sales of bitcoin on its Cash App platform in the first quarter of the year. 

In an earnings release on Thursday, the company said it sold $2.2 billion worth of bitcoin in the quarter, a 25% year-over-year increase. That's also an increase from $1.8 billion sold in the fourth quarter of last year.

Gross profits from bitcoin sales were $50 million, according to the Q1 shareholder letter. 

""The year-over-year increase in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of bitcoin compared to the prior-year period,"" Block said.

Voyager Digital is preparing to liquidate after its deal to sell assets to Binance.US fell apart.
The bankrupt lender could start making distributions “within the next few weeks.”

Bankrupt lender Voyager Digital could start distributing cash and crypto to creditors “within the next few weeks,” according to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the troubled crypto lender’s bankruptcy case.

The firm is finalizing the liquidation procedures after crypto exchange Binance.US pulled out of a $1.3 billion deal to buy its assets.

“Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors,” the creditors committee said on Twitter. ""We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.

The court-approved restructuring plan had included a “toggle” that allowed Voyager to liquidate if Binance.US decided to exit the deal. The crypto exchange said it backed away from the plan due to the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

The failed deal between Voyager and Binance.US was met with government scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in a court hearing that staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the country, although the commission hasn’t taken an official position.

Voyager bankruptcy asset recovery

Voyager must first file the liquidation procedures in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and parties will then have 10 days to object to the plan. The company said it had more than 100,000 creditors when it filed for bankruptcy protection last summer.

“If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go ‘effective’ with the plan at that time,” the committee said."" If an objection is filed, the Court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go effective.""

Of the 6% of creditors who voted on the proposed Voyager restructuring plan, 97% voted in favor. Customers would have seen a 73% recovery of assets under the Binance.US proposal, although that percentage could have dropped to 48% if claims from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sibling Alameda Research are eventually successful.

QUICK TAKE
With Star Wars NFTs, Disney takes one step closer into the world of crypto.
The digital toys will cost $39.99.

With wannabe Jedis rattling their lightsabers around the world in honor of Thursday's Star Wars Day celebrations, Cryptoys has announced it will be selling — in partnership with Disney — digital toys fashioned after three of the movie franchises' most iconic characters.

Cryptoys, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Mattel and Dapper Labs, said it will release “15 limited-edition Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Darth Vader collectible digital toys.”

Although The Walt Disney Company is one of the most successful marketers and sellers of merchandise based on famous intellectual property, the Hollywood studio and theme park operator has yet to make a big foray into crypto.

Last year, the media conglomerate advertised a job opening for a transaction lawyer to explore emerging technology opportunities, according to a posting on LinkedIn.

Powered by Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, consumers can buy Cryptoys Star Wars NFTs for $39.99. Purchases will be possible with Apple  Pay and Google Pay, “worldwide,” according to the company.

QUICK TAKE
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who’s a possible presidential candidate in next year’s election, alleged there were people that ‘want to get rid of crypto.’
DeSantis said this week that legislation to ban central bank digital currencies in the state is advancing.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the Sunshine state would soon move against any kind of a central bank digital currency, with lawmakers advancing with legislation that could be on his desk within ""the next couple of weeks.""

""Florida rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on May 2. ""You could just get fined, and they'll just take it right out of your digital currency, without any due process or anything like that. And so it gives the government a huge amount of power over your economic self sufficiency and independence.""

The Republican is an avid critic of centrally controlled digital currencies, but he's expressed support in the past for decentralized cryptocurrencies because the government has no control over them.

DeSantis, who's widely considered as a possible presidential candidate in next year's election, has previously accused President Joe Biden of eyeing the technology for “surveillance and control.” He first announced the legislation that would outlaw centralized digital currencies in the state in March. 

His Tuesday comments came amid widespread discussion of what's been perceived by some to be a broad crackdown on the crypto sector by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase, a U.S.-listed crypto exchange, is suing the regulator and calling for clear rules.  

Crypto crackdown

""They want to get rid of crypto,"" DeSantis said. ""They don't like crypto because they can't control crypto, so they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency.""

""My view is is like, if you want to invest in crypto, it's up to you,"" DeSantis continued. ""You can do it. I mean, like, you can make those decisions.""

DeSantis' press office said in an emailed response to questions that he was referring to ""those such as the Biden Administration."" In the Tuesday remarks, the governor said an agenda was being imposed by an ""elite"" with access to ""to a lot of financial might, a lot of business resources, corporate resources.""

DeSantis said the pending legislation in Florida would provide preemptive protection from a U.S. central bank digital currency, even though one doesn't yet exist.  

DeSantis warns against 'financial surveillance state'

""I don't think Congress would authorize it,"" DeSantis said. ""But if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally, in Florida, we'll have a prohibition against that. And I think that that's ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don't have a financial surveillance state, where they know every transaction that you're making.""

DeSantis first raised his opposition to centralized digital currencies last year, but he has previously taken a friendlier approach toward decentralized tokens and has said he was working on ways for Floridians to pay taxes with crypto.

The Biden administration has developed policy objectives for a possible CBDC system in the U.S., with the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department both conducting research in the area.

QUICK TAKE
The pepe memecoin climbed past $1 billion in market cap, pushing it into the ranks of the top 50 most valuable crypto tokens. 
Binance announced it would list the token today, while warning that it “has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team.”

Pepe, a crypto token styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon meme, climbed past $1 billion in market cap for the first time as traders pushed it into the top 50 most valuable coins. 

One pepe is currently worth $0.00000279, according to data provider CoinGecko. The token has risen 67% over the past 24 hours and surged more than 10-fold over the past week, making pepe the 45th largest by market value.  

Memecoins — which take a recognisable internet meme and add an element of financial speculation — have a long history in crypto, even if they have zero utility. Naive investors can be drawn into their parabolic gains, which have a habit of crashing suddenly and leaving those who bought near the top nursing huge losses. 

Two dog-themed tokens — dogecoin and shiba inu — have become fixtures in the ranks of the most valuable crypto projects since the pandemic-fueled market action of 2020 and 2021. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has regularly tweeted his appreciation for dogecoin, often with his tongue at least partly in his cheek, and research firms such as Chainalysis have bowed to pressure to cover it. 

""This is the purest representation of crypto’s speculative prowess,"" said Steven Zheng, research director at The Block Research. 

The gains in pepe came as Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, announced it would list the token for the first time. Binance clients will be able to trade pepe from Saturday.  

""Please note that the token has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team,"" Binance warned in its announcement.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added on Twitter, ""Meme coins (and all crypto) are high risk! Remember, no one is forcing you to buy them. [Do your own research] and be responsible for your own actions.""

Pepe volume overtakes dogecoin

For now, at least, pepe appears to have taken the crown as crypto's favorite memecoin. Earlier this week, trading volume for pepe exceeded that for both dogecoin and shiba inu. 

In fact, those trading the token on Uniswap have burned more than $10 million in Ethereum transaction fees — where a portion of the fee is destroyed instead of going to miners — over the last three weeks. This has boosted the amount of ether getting burned on the network, which is now up to around $60 million per week.

Despite the huge paper gains, those looking to cash in by selling might struggle with a lack of liquidity. A Nansen report this week highlighted one pepe early adopter selling $2.2 million of the token but only receiving $650,000 in ether “due to massive slippage.” 

Despite the skepticism, Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, highlighted that renewed interest in memecoins could have wider importance for crypto markets.

""Under the surface, we are starting to see increased activity that the more speculative parts of the crypto industry are awakening after almost a year in hibernation,"" Thielen wrote in a report.

As the artificial intelligence field continues to grow, the initial excitement has to faded and been replaced with fear, distrust, and a general unease. This comes as the media publishes headlines that read “A.I. is ‘one of the biggest risks’ to civilization” and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.

Humans vs Machines

After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.’s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving

cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That’s why augmented intelligence is the future. It’s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production – as it has happened after every technological revolution.

One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator’s own words, is designed “to empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.” Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what’s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. – Augmented Intelligence.

Case Study

The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control – like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human’s hand is continuously on Morgan’s “steering wheel.” The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn’t more parameters, it’s more quality and domain specific training.

MORGAN’s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like

MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower’s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:

This is the epitome of augmented intelligence — humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.

"Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering","May 5, 2023, 6:26AM EDT ","Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering

QUICK TAKE
A problematic transaction has caused issues for Bitcoin collectibles project Ordinals.
The transaction upset its inscription numbering system, according to developers discussing the issue.

Ordinals, the system by which digital collectibles are written onto the Bitcoin blockchain, is facing a new challenge after a developer found a way to introduce a bug into the metadata. 

The problem occurred when a developer known as Supertestnet initiated a transaction that didn’t output a satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but was seen as valid in the Ordinals system. As a result, it knocked the numbering system that Ordinals uses for its inscriptions off by one. 

“It shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own, so this is a bug. However, fixing the bug by making [Ordinals] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” said Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on GitHub.

Ordinals provide a way to store NFTs on Bitcoin after network upgrades made it easier and cheaper to store larger amounts of data. Inscriptions are the metadata added to satoshis that may include information as digital entries on Bitcoin's distributed public ledger.

Supertestnet also released a tool and related instructions for anyone else who wants to create the same types of problematic transactions. They illustrated their GitHub post with an image reading ""I am become Supertestnet, destroyer of JPEGs.""

 

Source: GitHub

Bitcoin Ordinals not broken yet

The bug isn't a huge problem as it doesn’t break the main Ordinals system of tracking satoshis, which are linked to collectibles, argued Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy. Instead, it refers to inscription numbers, a vanity metric marking the order in which each Ordinal collectible was created.

“This is totally fine,"" Diekroeger said on Twitter. ""In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway.” 

His view was backed by a developer known as Rijndael who said there shouldn’t be any impact on the actual Ordinals themselves, only the inscription numbering system.

Diekroeger also noted that the original transaction contained an inscription that promoted an alternative system for creating collectibles on Bitcoin called Soma.

Voyager Digital is preparing to liquidate after its deal to sell assets to Binance.US fell apart.
The bankrupt lender could start making distributions “within the next few weeks.”

Bankrupt lender Voyager Digital could start distributing cash and crypto to creditors “within the next few weeks,” according to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the troubled crypto lender’s bankruptcy case.

The firm is finalizing the liquidation procedures after crypto exchange Binance.US pulled out of a $1.3 billion deal to buy its assets.

“Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors,” the creditors committee said on Twitter. ""We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.

The court-approved restructuring plan had included a “toggle” that allowed Voyager to liquidate if Binance.US decided to exit the deal. The crypto exchange said it backed away from the plan due to the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

The failed deal between Voyager and Binance.US was met with government scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in a court hearing that staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the country, although the commission hasn’t taken an official position.

As the artificial intelligence field continues to grow, the initial excitement has to faded and been replaced with fear, distrust, and a general unease. This comes as the media publishes headlines that read “A.I. is ‘one of the biggest risks’ to civilization” and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.

Humans vs Machines

After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.’s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving

cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That’s why augmented intelligence is the future. It’s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production – as it has happened after every technological revolution.

One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator’s own words, is designed “to empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.” Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what’s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. – Augmented Intelligence.

Case Study

The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control – like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human’s hand is continuously on Morgan’s “steering wheel.” The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn’t more parameters, it’s more quality and domain specific training.

MORGAN’s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like

MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower’s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:

This is the epitome of augmented intelligence — humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.

QUICK TAKE
A problematic transaction has caused issues for Bitcoin collectibles project Ordinals.
The transaction upset its inscription numbering system, according to developers discussing the issue.

Ordinals, the system by which digital collectibles are written onto the Bitcoin blockchain, is facing a new challenge after a developer found a way to introduce a bug into the metadata. 

The problem occurred when a developer known as Supertestnet initiated a transaction that didn’t output a satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but was seen as valid in the Ordinals system. As a result, it knocked the numbering system that Ordinals uses for its inscriptions off by one. 

“It shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own, so this is a bug. However, fixing the bug by making [Ordinals] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” said Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on GitHub.

Ordinals provide a way to store NFTs on Bitcoin after network upgrades made it easier and cheaper to store larger amounts of data. Inscriptions are the metadata added to satoshis that may include information as digital entries on Bitcoin's distributed public ledger.

Supertestnet also released a tool and related instructions for anyone else who wants to create the same types of problematic transactions. They illustrated their GitHub post with an image reading ""I am become Supertestnet, destroyer of JPEGs.""

 

Source: GitHub

Bitcoin Ordinals not broken yet

The bug isn't a huge problem as it doesn’t break the main Ordinals system of tracking satoshis, which are linked to collectibles, argued Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy. Instead, it refers to inscription numbers, a vanity metric marking the order in which each Ordinal collectible was created.

“This is totally fine,"" Diekroeger said on Twitter. ""In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway.” 

His view was backed by a developer known as Rijndael who said there shouldn’t be any impact on the actual Ordinals themselves, only the inscription numbering system.

Diekroeger also noted that the original transaction contained an inscription that promoted an alternative system for creating collectibles on Bitcoin called Soma.

"As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run","May 5, 2023, 5:00AM EDT ","As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run

QUICK TAKE
Volumes have fallen steeply for Art Blocks, the generative art platform that boomed in the last crypto bull run. 
But founder Erick Calderon remains unwavering on topics such as creator royalties, while dismissing excessive fundraising as “gross.”
“I’m a little bit timid and hesitant… because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

By his own admission, Erick “Snowfro” Calderon is not a typical crypto founder.

Before founding Art Blocks, a marketplace for computer-generated artworks, he spent 20 years running a ceramic tile business. During the last bull market, he claims to have turned down multiple investment offers that would have valued Art Blocks at over $1 billion. He stands firm on the need to uphold creator royalties in the NFT space. And he has resisted the temptation to launch an Art Blocks token.

But most iconoclastic of all, he isn’t convinced there will be another crypto bull run.

“There are people that would accuse us of being not ambitious enough with the amount of funds that we have left,” Calderon, who is also Art Blocks’ CEO, said in an interview. “The reason that I’m a little bit timid and hesitant is because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

Art Blocks is in the business of auctioning off generative art in the form of NFT collections created by algorithms, albeit within parameters set by human artists. The platform was a darling of the 2021 crypto boom. In a single month in August 2021, it sold no less than $587 million worth of NFTs, according to CryptoSlam data.

But times have changed for Art Blocks, much as they have in the wider crypto space. The business recorded just $6.5 million in sales in April, the lowest total since May 2021. Around half the projects listed on the platform today don’t sell out, according to Calderon.

Yet Calderon, who is himself a generative artist, is stubborn. Even as volumes wane, he has stuck to his guns on topics such as creator royalties — despite other marketplaces in the sector deciding to waive them for the benefit of traders. While this and similar strategic choices are costing Art Blocks money in the short-term, Calderon remains optimistic.

“The vibes are negative, but the vision is very resolute,” he said. “I’m just as excited today — I’m maybe more excited today — than I was in 2021 and I just want people to know that.”

Art Blocks' royalties pain

Art Blocks’ stance on royalties — the levy paid to creators on secondary sales of their NFTs — is an apt illustration of how the business has positioned itself.

Blur, the recently launched NFT marketplace targeting pro traders, set its royalty fee at just 0.5% in February. In response, rival OpenSea dropped its 2.5% fee to zero for a limited time.

Art Blocks, which has a secondary market of its own, continues to enforce full royalty fees of 5%. That means collectors must spend more to buy an NFT on Art Blocks than they would for the same NFT on Blur or OpenSea. Inevitably, that has put a dent in revenues.

“Art Blocks has lost a significant amount of income as a result of royalties,” Calderon said, adding that the royalty fees had previously provided the bulk of the firm’s event budgets.

But Calderon thinks artists create higher quality work — in part because it’s less necessary for them to continually produce — and are generally more engaged with their audiences when royalties are upheld. “To me it just seems very straightforward that the ecosystem will be a better place if royalties are respected,” he added.

Blur, Calderon said, is “the antithesis of being about the art,” and is much more focused on market mechanics and traders. “I’m also very frustrated with what’s happening, but if it wasn’t them, it would be somebody else doing it,” Calderon said.

Art Blocks' unicorn snub

Even with revenue down, Art Blocks remains a ""well-capitalized company,” according to Calderon.

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

CATARINA MOURA
00:00 / 00:00

The startup may not have raised at a billion-dollar valuation, but it did bring in some cash through a $6 million round that closed in August 2021. True Ventures, Galaxy Interactive and Collab Currency invested alongside existing backers Libertus Capital, Flamingo DAO and The LAO.

The bulk of the capital at Art Blocks’ disposal today, however, comes from the revenue it booked in the bull run. The company takes a 10% fee on primary sales and 2.5% of any secondary transactions, according to its website. A straightforward calculation suggests, therefore, that Art Blocks banked at least $58 million in revenue in the month of August 2021 alone.

“We had a crazy year in 2021,” Calderon said. Naturally, after the $6 million round, bigger backers came knocking.

Calderon said he fielded offers both to invest in Art Blocks and to buy the company outright at valuations in excess of $1 billion. He declined to name the investors.

“Why we didn’t raise more money? Because I thought it would be gross to raise more money when everything was just peak FOMO,” he said. “I’m sitting here thinking, ‘OK yeah, I can see that from the numbers now, but what on earth makes you think that these numbers are going to continue forever?’ It’s completely unreasonable.”

Cost-wise, the operation appears to have stayed fairly lean; Calderon said Art Blocks’ current headcount is 40 people. And as alluded to earlier, Art Blocks does not seem to burn through cash quite so hungrily as the average tech startup. Calderon sees a runway of one to two years as “too low,” mindful of the often-stellar jobs his staff left to join what remains a fairly zany startup.

Carry on canoeing

Keep calm and carry on seems to be the basis of Calderon’s plan for navigating a rough period for crypto firms.

“We’re in a canoe, going down a river that’s moving very fast, with tiny little paddles, and all we can do just from a mental health standpoint is just keep f---ing doing what we’re doing,” he said.

Which is not to say that Art Blocks doesn’t have any new ideas in the works. Calderon speaks enthusiastically about potential use cases for Art Blocks’ on-demand minting technology — at the heart of which is the 1 of 1 of X concept — in other industries, such as fashion or even ceramic tiles. Art Blocks is hoping to position the platform as an “engine partner” for such endeavors, Calderon said.

In October last year, Tyler Hobbs, creator of an Art Blocks’ smash hit collection called Fidenza, made $17 million selling passes that gave buyers a level of control over the look of NFTs minted from his QQL collection. By toying with knobs and dials, pass-holders can manipulate the QQL algorithm to suit their fancy.

Art Blocks is working on new minting mechanics of its own, due next quarter, Calderon said. There will be less of a manual element, however.

Calderon acknowledges that Art Blocks must hit “homeostasis” at some point. To do that, the startup and indeed the industry needs to find ways to access a bigger market.

“Some people are just so focused on extracting every last dollar from every last person in the industry that are here, that they’re not spending any time on thinking, ‘how do I make this thing appealing to the outside world?’ And I think that’s where we could shoot ourselves in the foot as an industry,” Calderon said.  

“If Art Blocks doesn’t make it through this, it’s like the value proposition of the NFT just disappears.”

QUICK TAKE
Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow’s team denies she invested in NFT project called Wild. The company disputes the claim.
Celebrities who once fawned over them have been turning their back on digital assets in the wake of a downturn in the industry and fallout from scandals like FTX’s collapse.
“Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” according to Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain

Two months ago, a little-known NFT startup geared toward helping up-and-coming artists introduced itself to the world. Dubbed Wild, it sported a bevy of business luminaries as backers like founders Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Kevin Lin of Twitch.

But leading the headlines at the time, both in The Block's reporting and elsewhere, was actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The Oscar winner and founder of the multimillion-dollar Goop wellness brand empire was reported at the time to have invested in Wild. Now that's in dispute.

Nearly two months later, a representative of Paltrow’s said over the weekend that it was “completely false” that she invested in Wild, while a spokesperson for Wild later said in a statement that the “initial reporting is correct.”

Paltrow’s team seemingly distancing her from a crypto-related project after the fact — Wild used her name online as far back as March when The Block and others initially reported the actress’s  involvement — is just the latest example in an ongoing parade of once-eager celebrities turning their back on the digital assets industry.

“We’ve obviously seen the implosion of crypto,” said Les Borsai, a veteran of the music industry who co-founded Wave Digital Assets. “We’ve seen the SEC go after celebrities. There’s concern. So it’s not the usual greed mechanism kicking in to say ‘I can go do a crypto thing, or a web3 thing, without consequence.’ Their representation is not stupid.”

Fallon, Damon and FTX boosters

Last year “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon stopped using a Bored Ape NFT as his avatar on Twitter and the market began to sour. Actor Matt Damon said he took money to do a Crypto.com advertisement because he needed money for his nonprofit that helps people access clean water and sanitation. Shaquille O’Neal said he was ""just a paid spokesperson"" for FTX – and is facing a class-action suit – for his decision to promote the now disgraced crypto trading platform.

Although it comes weeks after the news of Paltrow’s now disputed investment was made public, Paltrow’s team was stern in their denial, repeating it three times by email.

“We were alerted to the story on Gwyneth Paltrow backing web3 art platform Wild,” Goop EVP Noora Raj Brown said in her first email denying her boss’s involvement, sent last Saturday. “This story is completely false and Gwyneth is not an investor in the platform.” 

The Block corrected its early March story based upon Brown’s email, stripping it of any mention of Paltrow. At the original time of publishing, Wild founder and Chief Executive J. Douglass Kobs told The Block in a written interview that Paltrow had invested in the web3 company alongside Matrix Partners, LinkedIn's Hoffman and Twitch's Lin.

Wild's CEO says he met Paltrow at a leadership summit

In the March story about Wild, Kobs said that he and Paltrow became friends after meeting at a leadership summit in 2021, adding that she's an ""early adopter"" of web3 and NFTs. The crypto news outlet Decrypt also reported the news of Paltrow's involvement, as did CoinDesk. Evidence of Paltrow’s disputed involvement also exists elsewhere online, including a link to Wild's original announcement accessible from OpenSea, a premiere NFT marketplace.

It is not unheard of for projects to announce a slate of backers only to have some publicly refute any such involvement. Just this week, Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek issued a statement denying it had invested in a crypto startup named Array. Last month, no less than four supposed backers of the fledgling OPNX exchange said they weren’t investors after the startup had claimed they were.

Celebrity advisors have for months been trying to help their clients avoid getting mixed up in an industry still going through serious growing pains and intense regulatory and political scrutiny.

Months ago, ​one top Hollywood agent told The Block his firm was spending a significant amount of time advising clients against promoting crypto-related projects. “You don’t want to go and do something that is going to jeopardize your credibility in the space,” they said at the time.

Not enough marketing dollars

The current trend of fewer celebrity endorsements of crypto projects is also being driven by companies having less money to spend on marketing, said Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain.

Speaking from personal experience, Georgiades said he had multiple discussions with celebrities enthusiastic about working on a NFT project only to have them later retract “any interest in getting involved” when they felt they were not being properly compensated. Even if he didn’t take the news well, he understands their perspective. “Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” he said.

Borsai, who is passionate about creating a new paradigm with web3 that will redefine the rights celebrities and influencers possess in terms of monetizing the content they create and their reach, said he dreams of a world where the crypto endorsements of the past are not repeated.   

“I don’t believe we should live in a culture where we pay Kim Kardashian $2 million dollars to speak about something she doesn’t understand,” said Borsai. “That’s why she got in trouble with the SEC. I would never use anyone like Kim Kardashian.”

Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax on Instagram and then the SEC penalized her, forcing her to pay $1.26 million, the regulatory agency said last year.

Coinbase EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than estimates of negative $36 million. 
Interest income rose to $240 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC.
Coinbase is ‘fully prepared’ to face off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it says.

Coinbase reported first-quarter revenue up 22% as cost-cutting measures paid dividends. Shares popped 7% in after-hours trading.

Interest income rose 32% to $240 million, above estimates of $205 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC. In the fourth quarter, interest income totaled $182 million, of which $146 million was USDC.

The cryptocurrency exchange said revenue for the first quarter was $736 million, coming in above the $658 million estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than the negative $36 million estimated. 

Subscription and services helped drive this growth, said the firm's vice president of investor relations, Anil Gupta, in an interview with The Block following the release. Subscription and services revenue, which included staking and interest income, was $362 million, above estimates of $316 million. 

The declining circulating supply of USDC may have a more outsized impact on Coinbase's revenue as the year progresses, Mizuho's Ryan Coyne told The Block ahead of time. Gupta confirmed the exchange expects interest income derived from USDC to fall in the second quarter due to this.

Staking accounted for $73.7 million, above the $71 million estimated by FactSet. It did, however, lead to an increase in transaction expenses as rewards are paid out to users, the firm noted. Staking was under the microscope during the first quarter. Kraken reached a $30 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in Coinbase tumbled as the SEC came down on staking as staking revenues came under threat.

Trading volume was flat quarter on quarter, marking the first time since the crypto winter began the exchange's quarterly volume did not decline. Monthly transacting users climbed modestly to 8.4 million from 8.3 million.
 
Coinbase ‘fully prepared' to fight the SEC

Coinbase also provided shareholders with an update on its looming legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a key U.S. regulator. The SEC gave Coinbase official notice that it was the subject of an investigation last month with a Wells Notice, a document that can precede an enforcement action.

The company responded to the notice last week, warning that an enforcement action against Coinbase would not be in the country’s interest. Separately, Coinbase is suing the SEC to answer its request for a digital asset-specific rule.

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the SEC, they have not shared their specific concerns with Coinbase or provided any clarity or workable path forward for the industry. While we hope to avoid litigation, we are fully prepared to defend ourselves and advocate for the entire crypto industry if necessary,” Coinbase wrote in its shareholder letter.

Coinbase said its “preferred path would be for Congress to take action to provide clear rules of the road for the industry.” The exchange hinted that “real action” could be taken on “substantive, bipartisan legislation” during the second quarter of 2023, which ends in June.

“We are also digging in on our direct advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. We need crypto-specific rules and regulation, not more enforcement, to help this innovative technology flourish and for America to maintain its leadership position,” the letter said.

Block sold $2.2 billion in bitcoin in Q1 2023 via Cash App.
That figure represents a 25% year-over-year increase, according to Block’s quarterly results. 

Block, formerly known as Square, reported surging sales of bitcoin on its Cash App platform in the first quarter of the year. 

In an earnings release on Thursday, the company said it sold $2.2 billion worth of bitcoin in the quarter, a 25% year-over-year increase. That's also an increase from $1.8 billion sold in the fourth quarter of last year.

Gross profits from bitcoin sales were $50 million, according to the Q1 shareholder letter. 

""The year-over-year increase in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of bitcoin compared to the prior-year period,"" Block said.

QUICK TAKE
Voyager Digital is preparing to liquidate after its deal to sell assets to Binance.US fell apart.
The bankrupt lender could start making distributions “within the next few weeks.”

Bankrupt lender Voyager Digital could start distributing cash and crypto to creditors “within the next few weeks,” according to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the troubled crypto lender’s bankruptcy case.

The firm is finalizing the liquidation procedures after crypto exchange Binance.US pulled out of a $1.3 billion deal to buy its assets.

“Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors,” the creditors committee said on Twitter. ""We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.

The court-approved restructuring plan had included a “toggle” that allowed Voyager to liquidate if Binance.US decided to exit the deal. The crypto exchange said it backed away from the plan due to the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

The failed deal between Voyager and Binance.US was met with government scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in a court hearing that staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the country, although the commission hasn’t taken an official position.

Voyager bankruptcy asset recovery

Voyager must first file the liquidation procedures in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and parties will then have 10 days to object to the plan. The company said it had more than 100,000 creditors when it filed for bankruptcy protection last summer.

“If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go ‘effective’ with the plan at that time,” the committee said."" If an objection is filed, the Court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go effective.""

Of the 6% of creditors who voted on the proposed Voyager restructuring plan, 97% voted in favor. Customers would have seen a 73% recovery of assets under the Binance.US proposal, although that percentage could have dropped to 48% if claims from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sibling Alameda Research are eventually successful.

With Star Wars NFTs, Disney takes one step closer into the world of crypto.
The digital toys will cost $39.99.

With wannabe Jedis rattling their lightsabers around the world in honor of Thursday's Star Wars Day celebrations, Cryptoys has announced it will be selling — in partnership with Disney — digital toys fashioned after three of the movie franchises' most iconic characters.

Cryptoys, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Mattel and Dapper Labs, said it will release “15 limited-edition Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Darth Vader collectible digital toys.”

Although The Walt Disney Company is one of the most successful marketers and sellers of merchandise based on famous intellectual property, the Hollywood studio and theme park operator has yet to make a big foray into crypto.

Last year, the media conglomerate advertised a job opening for a transaction lawyer to explore emerging technology opportunities, according to a posting on LinkedIn.

Powered by Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, consumers can buy Cryptoys Star Wars NFTs for $39.99. Purchases will be possible with Apple  Pay and Google Pay, “worldwide,” according to the company.

"Biden wants 'to get rid of crypto,' Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warns","May 4, 2023, 12:50PM EDT ","Biden wants 'to get rid of crypto,' Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warns

QUICK TAKE
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who’s a possible presidential candidate in next year’s election, alleged there were people that ‘want to get rid of crypto.’
DeSantis said this week that legislation to ban central bank digital currencies in the state is advancing.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the Sunshine state would soon move against any kind of a central bank digital currency, with lawmakers advancing with legislation that could be on his desk within ""the next couple of weeks.""

""Florida rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on May 2. ""You could just get fined, and they'll just take it right out of your digital currency, without any due process or anything like that. And so it gives the government a huge amount of power over your economic self sufficiency and independence.""

The Republican is an avid critic of centrally controlled digital currencies, but he's expressed support in the past for decentralized cryptocurrencies because the government has no control over them.

DeSantis, who's widely considered as a possible presidential candidate in next year's election, has previously accused President Joe Biden of eyeing the technology for “surveillance and control.” He first announced the legislation that would outlaw centralized digital currencies in the state in March. 

His Tuesday comments came amid widespread discussion of what's been perceived by some to be a broad crackdown on the crypto sector by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase, a U.S.-listed crypto exchange, is suing the regulator and calling for clear rules.  

Crypto crackdown

""They want to get rid of crypto,"" DeSantis said. ""They don't like crypto because they can't control crypto, so they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency.""

""My view is is like, if you want to invest in crypto, it's up to you,"" DeSantis continued. ""You can do it. I mean, like, you can make those decisions.""

DeSantis' press office said in an emailed response to questions that he was referring to ""those such as the Biden Administration."" In the Tuesday remarks, the governor said an agenda was being imposed by an ""elite"" with access to ""to a lot of financial might, a lot of business resources, corporate resources.""

DeSantis said the pending legislation in Florida would provide preemptive protection from a U.S. central bank digital currency, even though one doesn't yet exist.  

DeSantis warns against 'financial surveillance state'

""I don't think Congress would authorize it,"" DeSantis said. ""But if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally, in Florida, we'll have a prohibition against that. And I think that that's ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don't have a financial surveillance state, where they know every transaction that you're making.""

DeSantis first raised his opposition to centralized digital currencies last year, but he has previously taken a friendlier approach toward decentralized tokens and has said he was working on ways for Floridians to pay taxes with crypto.

The Biden administration has developed policy objectives for a possible CBDC system in the U.S., with the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department both conducting research in the area.

"Pepe memecoin tops $1 billion market cap even as Binance flags lack of utility","May 5, 2023, 9:01AM EDT ","Pepe memecoin tops $1 billion market cap even as Binance flags lack of utility

QUICK TAKE
The pepe memecoin climbed past $1 billion in market cap, pushing it into the ranks of the top 50 most valuable crypto tokens. 
Binance announced it would list the token today, while warning that it “has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team.”

Pepe, a crypto token styled on the Pepe the Frog cartoon meme, climbed past $1 billion in market cap for the first time as traders pushed it into the top 50 most valuable coins. 

One pepe is currently worth $0.00000279, according to data provider CoinGecko. The token has risen 67% over the past 24 hours and surged more than 10-fold over the past week, making pepe the 45th largest by market value.  

Memecoins — which take a recognisable internet meme and add an element of financial speculation — have a long history in crypto, even if they have zero utility. Naive investors can be drawn into their parabolic gains, which have a habit of crashing suddenly and leaving those who bought near the top nursing huge losses. 

Two dog-themed tokens — dogecoin and shiba inu — have become fixtures in the ranks of the most valuable crypto projects since the pandemic-fueled market action of 2020 and 2021. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has regularly tweeted his appreciation for dogecoin, often with his tongue at least partly in his cheek, and research firms such as Chainalysis have bowed to pressure to cover it. 

""This is the purest representation of crypto’s speculative prowess,"" said Steven Zheng, research director at The Block Research. 

The gains in pepe came as Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, announced it would list the token for the first time. Binance clients will be able to trade pepe from Saturday.  

""Please note that the token has no utility and it is created by an anonymous team,"" Binance warned in its announcement.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added on Twitter, ""Meme coins (and all crypto) are high risk! Remember, no one is forcing you to buy them. [Do your own research] and be responsible for your own actions.""

Pepe volume overtakes dogecoin

For now, at least, pepe appears to have taken the crown as crypto's favorite memecoin. Earlier this week, trading volume for pepe exceeded that for both dogecoin and shiba inu. 

In fact, those trading the token on Uniswap have burned more than $10 million in Ethereum transaction fees — where a portion of the fee is destroyed instead of going to miners — over the last three weeks. This has boosted the amount of ether getting burned on the network, which is now up to around $60 million per week.

Despite the huge paper gains, those looking to cash in by selling might struggle with a lack of liquidity. A Nansen report this week highlighted one pepe early adopter selling $2.2 million of the token but only receiving $650,000 in ether “due to massive slippage.” 

Despite the skepticism, Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, highlighted that renewed interest in memecoins could have wider importance for crypto markets.

""Under the surface, we are starting to see increased activity that the more speculative parts of the crypto industry are awakening after almost a year in hibernation,"" Thielen wrote in a report.

As the artificial intelligence field continues to grow, the initial excitement has to faded and been replaced with fear, distrust, and a general unease. This comes as the media publishes headlines that read “A.I. is ‘one of the biggest risks’ to civilization” and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.

Humans vs Machines

After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.’s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving

cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That’s why augmented intelligence is the future. It’s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production – as it has happened after every technological revolution.

One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator’s own words, is designed “to empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.” Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what’s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. – Augmented Intelligence.

Case Study

The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control – like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human’s hand is continuously on Morgan’s “steering wheel.” The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn’t more parameters, it’s more quality and domain specific training.

MORGAN’s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like

MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower’s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:

This is the epitome of augmented intelligence — humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.

"Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering","May 5, 2023, 6:26AM EDT ","Bitcoin Ordinals faces new challenge after developer inserts bug to throw out numbering

QUICK TAKE
A problematic transaction has caused issues for Bitcoin collectibles project Ordinals.
The transaction upset its inscription numbering system, according to developers discussing the issue.

Ordinals, the system by which digital collectibles are written onto the Bitcoin blockchain, is facing a new challenge after a developer found a way to introduce a bug into the metadata. 

The problem occurred when a developer known as Supertestnet initiated a transaction that didn’t output a satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin) but was seen as valid in the Ordinals system. As a result, it knocked the numbering system that Ordinals uses for its inscriptions off by one. 

“It shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own, so this is a bug. However, fixing the bug by making [Ordinals] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!” said Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on GitHub.

Ordinals provide a way to store NFTs on Bitcoin after network upgrades made it easier and cheaper to store larger amounts of data. Inscriptions are the metadata added to satoshis that may include information as digital entries on Bitcoin's distributed public ledger.

Supertestnet also released a tool and related instructions for anyone else who wants to create the same types of problematic transactions. They illustrated their GitHub post with an image reading ""I am become Supertestnet, destroyer of JPEGs.""

 

Source: GitHub

Bitcoin Ordinals not broken yet

The bug isn't a huge problem as it doesn’t break the main Ordinals system of tracking satoshis, which are linked to collectibles, argued Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy. Instead, it refers to inscription numbers, a vanity metric marking the order in which each Ordinal collectible was created.

“This is totally fine,"" Diekroeger said on Twitter. ""In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway.” 

His view was backed by a developer known as Rijndael who said there shouldn’t be any impact on the actual Ordinals themselves, only the inscription numbering system.

Diekroeger also noted that the original transaction contained an inscription that promoted an alternative system for creating collectibles on Bitcoin called Soma.

"As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run","May 5, 2023, 5:00AM EDT ","As NFT sales dwindle, Art Blocks resists pinning hopes on a renewed crypto bull run

QUICK TAKE
Volumes have fallen steeply for Art Blocks, the generative art platform that boomed in the last crypto bull run. 
But founder Erick Calderon remains unwavering on topics such as creator royalties, while dismissing excessive fundraising as “gross.”
“I’m a little bit timid and hesitant… because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

By his own admission, Erick “Snowfro” Calderon is not a typical crypto founder.

Before founding Art Blocks, a marketplace for computer-generated artworks, he spent 20 years running a ceramic tile business. During the last bull market, he claims to have turned down multiple investment offers that would have valued Art Blocks at over $1 billion. He stands firm on the need to uphold creator royalties in the NFT space. And he has resisted the temptation to launch an Art Blocks token.

But most iconoclastic of all, he isn’t convinced there will be another crypto bull run.

“There are people that would accuse us of being not ambitious enough with the amount of funds that we have left,” Calderon, who is also Art Blocks’ CEO, said in an interview. “The reason that I’m a little bit timid and hesitant is because I think a lot of that ‘invest in your startup’ mentality is just waiting for that next bull run — and there may not be another bull run.”

Art Blocks is in the business of auctioning off generative art in the form of NFT collections created by algorithms, albeit within parameters set by human artists. The platform was a darling of the 2021 crypto boom. In a single month in August 2021, it sold no less than $587 million worth of NFTs, according to CryptoSlam data.

But times have changed for Art Blocks, much as they have in the wider crypto space. The business recorded just $6.5 million in sales in April, the lowest total since May 2021. Around half the projects listed on the platform today don’t sell out, according to Calderon.

Yet Calderon, who is himself a generative artist, is stubborn. Even as volumes wane, he has stuck to his guns on topics such as creator royalties — despite other marketplaces in the sector deciding to waive them for the benefit of traders. While this and similar strategic choices are costing Art Blocks money in the short-term, Calderon remains optimistic.

“The vibes are negative, but the vision is very resolute,” he said. “I’m just as excited today — I’m maybe more excited today — than I was in 2021 and I just want people to know that.”

Art Blocks' royalties pain

Art Blocks’ stance on royalties — the levy paid to creators on secondary sales of their NFTs — is an apt illustration of how the business has positioned itself.

Blur, the recently launched NFT marketplace targeting pro traders, set its royalty fee at just 0.5% in February. In response, rival OpenSea dropped its 2.5% fee to zero for a limited time.

Art Blocks, which has a secondary market of its own, continues to enforce full royalty fees of 5%. That means collectors must spend more to buy an NFT on Art Blocks than they would for the same NFT on Blur or OpenSea. Inevitably, that has put a dent in revenues.

“Art Blocks has lost a significant amount of income as a result of royalties,” Calderon said, adding that the royalty fees had previously provided the bulk of the firm’s event budgets.

But Calderon thinks artists create higher quality work — in part because it’s less necessary for them to continually produce — and are generally more engaged with their audiences when royalties are upheld. “To me it just seems very straightforward that the ecosystem will be a better place if royalties are respected,” he added.

Blur, Calderon said, is “the antithesis of being about the art,” and is much more focused on market mechanics and traders. “I’m also very frustrated with what’s happening, but if it wasn’t them, it would be somebody else doing it,” Calderon said.

Art Blocks' unicorn snub

Even with revenue down, Art Blocks remains a ""well-capitalized company,” according to Calderon.

Bitcoin mining report: Jan. 13

00:00 / 00:00

The startup may not have raised at a billion-dollar valuation, but it did bring in some cash through a $6 million round that closed in August 2021. True Ventures, Galaxy Interactive and Collab Currency invested alongside existing backers Libertus Capital, Flamingo DAO and The LAO.

The bulk of the capital at Art Blocks’ disposal today, however, comes from the revenue it booked in the bull run. The company takes a 10% fee on primary sales and 2.5% of any secondary transactions, according to its website. A straightforward calculation suggests, therefore, that Art Blocks banked at least $58 million in revenue in the month of August 2021 alone.

“We had a crazy year in 2021,” Calderon said. Naturally, after the $6 million round, bigger backers came knocking.

Calderon said he fielded offers both to invest in Art Blocks and to buy the company outright at valuations in excess of $1 billion. He declined to name the investors.

“Why we didn’t raise more money? Because I thought it would be gross to raise more money when everything was just peak FOMO,” he said. “I’m sitting here thinking, ‘OK yeah, I can see that from the numbers now, but what on earth makes you think that these numbers are going to continue forever?’ It’s completely unreasonable.”

Cost-wise, the operation appears to have stayed fairly lean; Calderon said Art Blocks’ current headcount is 40 people. And as alluded to earlier, Art Blocks does not seem to burn through cash quite so hungrily as the average tech startup. Calderon sees a runway of one to two years as “too low,” mindful of the often-stellar jobs his staff left to join what remains a fairly zany startup.

Carry on canoeing

Keep calm and carry on seems to be the basis of Calderon’s plan for navigating a rough period for crypto firms.

“We’re in a canoe, going down a river that’s moving very fast, with tiny little paddles, and all we can do just from a mental health standpoint is just keep f---ing doing what we’re doing,” he said.

Which is not to say that Art Blocks doesn’t have any new ideas in the works. Calderon speaks enthusiastically about potential use cases for Art Blocks’ on-demand minting technology — at the heart of which is the 1 of 1 of X concept — in other industries, such as fashion or even ceramic tiles. Art Blocks is hoping to position the platform as an “engine partner” for such endeavors, Calderon said.

In October last year, Tyler Hobbs, creator of an Art Blocks’ smash hit collection called Fidenza, made $17 million selling passes that gave buyers a level of control over the look of NFTs minted from his QQL collection. By toying with knobs and dials, pass-holders can manipulate the QQL algorithm to suit their fancy.

Art Blocks is working on new minting mechanics of its own, due next quarter, Calderon said. There will be less of a manual element, however.

Calderon acknowledges that Art Blocks must hit “homeostasis” at some point. To do that, the startup and indeed the industry needs to find ways to access a bigger market.

“Some people are just so focused on extracting every last dollar from every last person in the industry that are here, that they’re not spending any time on thinking, ‘how do I make this thing appealing to the outside world?’ And I think that’s where we could shoot ourselves in the foot as an industry,” Calderon said.  

“If Art Blocks doesn’t make it through this, it’s like the value proposition of the NFT just disappears.”

QUICK TAKE
Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow’s team denies she invested in NFT project called Wild. The company disputes the claim.
Celebrities who once fawned over them have been turning their back on digital assets in the wake of a downturn in the industry and fallout from scandals like FTX’s collapse.
“Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” according to Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain

Two months ago, a little-known NFT startup geared toward helping up-and-coming artists introduced itself to the world. Dubbed Wild, it sported a bevy of business luminaries as backers like founders Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Kevin Lin of Twitch.

But leading the headlines at the time, both in The Block's reporting and elsewhere, was actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The Oscar winner and founder of the multimillion-dollar Goop wellness brand empire was reported at the time to have invested in Wild. Now that's in dispute.

Nearly two months later, a representative of Paltrow’s said over the weekend that it was “completely false” that she invested in Wild, while a spokesperson for Wild later said in a statement that the “initial reporting is correct.”

Paltrow’s team seemingly distancing her from a crypto-related project after the fact — Wild used her name online as far back as March when The Block and others initially reported the actress’s  involvement — is just the latest example in an ongoing parade of once-eager celebrities turning their back on the digital assets industry.

“We’ve obviously seen the implosion of crypto,” said Les Borsai, a veteran of the music industry who co-founded Wave Digital Assets. “We’ve seen the SEC go after celebrities. There’s concern. So it’s not the usual greed mechanism kicking in to say ‘I can go do a crypto thing, or a web3 thing, without consequence.’ Their representation is not stupid.”

Fallon, Damon and FTX boosters

Last year “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon stopped using a Bored Ape NFT as his avatar on Twitter and the market began to sour. Actor Matt Damon said he took money to do a Crypto.com advertisement because he needed money for his nonprofit that helps people access clean water and sanitation. Shaquille O’Neal said he was ""just a paid spokesperson"" for FTX – and is facing a class-action suit – for his decision to promote the now disgraced crypto trading platform.

Although it comes weeks after the news of Paltrow’s now disputed investment was made public, Paltrow’s team was stern in their denial, repeating it three times by email.

“We were alerted to the story on Gwyneth Paltrow backing web3 art platform Wild,” Goop EVP Noora Raj Brown said in her first email denying her boss’s involvement, sent last Saturday. “This story is completely false and Gwyneth is not an investor in the platform.” 

The Block corrected its early March story based upon Brown’s email, stripping it of any mention of Paltrow. At the original time of publishing, Wild founder and Chief Executive J. Douglass Kobs told The Block in a written interview that Paltrow had invested in the web3 company alongside Matrix Partners, LinkedIn's Hoffman and Twitch's Lin.

Wild's CEO says he met Paltrow at a leadership summit

In the March story about Wild, Kobs said that he and Paltrow became friends after meeting at a leadership summit in 2021, adding that she's an ""early adopter"" of web3 and NFTs. The crypto news outlet Decrypt also reported the news of Paltrow's involvement, as did CoinDesk. Evidence of Paltrow’s disputed involvement also exists elsewhere online, including a link to Wild's original announcement accessible from OpenSea, a premiere NFT marketplace.

It is not unheard of for projects to announce a slate of backers only to have some publicly refute any such involvement. Just this week, Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek issued a statement denying it had invested in a crypto startup named Array. Last month, no less than four supposed backers of the fledgling OPNX exchange said they weren’t investors after the startup had claimed they were.

Celebrity advisors have for months been trying to help their clients avoid getting mixed up in an industry still going through serious growing pains and intense regulatory and political scrutiny.

Months ago, ​one top Hollywood agent told The Block his firm was spending a significant amount of time advising clients against promoting crypto-related projects. “You don’t want to go and do something that is going to jeopardize your credibility in the space,” they said at the time.

Not enough marketing dollars

The current trend of fewer celebrity endorsements of crypto projects is also being driven by companies having less money to spend on marketing, said Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, an NFT-focused blockchain.

Speaking from personal experience, Georgiades said he had multiple discussions with celebrities enthusiastic about working on a NFT project only to have them later retract “any interest in getting involved” when they felt they were not being properly compensated. Even if he didn’t take the news well, he understands their perspective. “Why even risk it? There’s too much scrutiny, too much uncertainty,” he said.

Borsai, who is passionate about creating a new paradigm with web3 that will redefine the rights celebrities and influencers possess in terms of monetizing the content they create and their reach, said he dreams of a world where the crypto endorsements of the past are not repeated.   

“I don’t believe we should live in a culture where we pay Kim Kardashian $2 million dollars to speak about something she doesn’t understand,” said Borsai. “That’s why she got in trouble with the SEC. I would never use anyone like Kim Kardashian.”

Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax on Instagram and then the SEC penalized her, forcing her to pay $1.26 million, the regulatory agency said last year.

QUICK TAKE
Coinbase EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than estimates of negative $36 million. 
Interest income rose to $240 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC.
Coinbase is ‘fully prepared’ to face off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it says.

Coinbase reported first-quarter revenue up 22% as cost-cutting measures paid dividends. Shares popped 7% in after-hours trading.

Interest income rose 32% to $240 million, above estimates of $205 million, of which $199 million was derived from USDC. In the fourth quarter, interest income totaled $182 million, of which $146 million was USDC.

The cryptocurrency exchange said revenue for the first quarter was $736 million, coming in above the $658 million estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. EBITDA was positive $284 million, better than the negative $36 million estimated. 

Subscription and services helped drive this growth, said the firm's vice president of investor relations, Anil Gupta, in an interview with The Block following the release. Subscription and services revenue, which included staking and interest income, was $362 million, above estimates of $316 million. 

The declining circulating supply of USDC may have a more outsized impact on Coinbase's revenue as the year progresses, Mizuho's Ryan Coyne told The Block ahead of time. Gupta confirmed the exchange expects interest income derived from USDC to fall in the second quarter due to this.

Staking accounted for $73.7 million, above the $71 million estimated by FactSet. It did, however, lead to an increase in transaction expenses as rewards are paid out to users, the firm noted. Staking was under the microscope during the first quarter. Kraken reached a $30 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in Coinbase tumbled as the SEC came down on staking as staking revenues came under threat.

Trading volume was flat quarter on quarter, marking the first time since the crypto winter began the exchange's quarterly volume did not decline. Monthly transacting users climbed modestly to 8.4 million from 8.3 million.
 
Coinbase ‘fully prepared' to fight the SEC

Coinbase also provided shareholders with an update on its looming legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a key U.S. regulator. The SEC gave Coinbase official notice that it was the subject of an investigation last month with a Wells Notice, a document that can precede an enforcement action.

The company responded to the notice last week, warning that an enforcement action against Coinbase would not be in the country’s interest. Separately, Coinbase is suing the SEC to answer its request for a digital asset-specific rule.

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the SEC, they have not shared their specific concerns with Coinbase or provided any clarity or workable path forward for the industry. While we hope to avoid litigation, we are fully prepared to defend ourselves and advocate for the entire crypto industry if necessary,” Coinbase wrote in its shareholder letter.

Coinbase said its “preferred path would be for Congress to take action to provide clear rules of the road for the industry.” The exchange hinted that “real action” could be taken on “substantive, bipartisan legislation” during the second quarter of 2023, which ends in June.

“We are also digging in on our direct advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. We need crypto-specific rules and regulation, not more enforcement, to help this innovative technology flourish and for America to maintain its leadership position,” the letter said.

QUICK TAKE
Block sold $2.2 billion in bitcoin in Q1 2023 via Cash App.
That figure represents a 25% year-over-year increase, according to Block’s quarterly results. 

Block, formerly known as Square, reported surging sales of bitcoin on its Cash App platform in the first quarter of the year. 

In an earnings release on Thursday, the company said it sold $2.2 billion worth of bitcoin in the quarter, a 25% year-over-year increase. That's also an increase from $1.8 billion sold in the fourth quarter of last year.

Gross profits from bitcoin sales were $50 million, according to the Q1 shareholder letter. 

""The year-over-year increase in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of bitcoin compared to the prior-year period,"" Block said.

Block profits rise

Block reported an overall gross profit of $1.7 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase, with total revenue of just under $5 billion in the period.

Voyager Digital is preparing to liquidate after its deal to sell assets to Binance.US fell apart.
The bankrupt lender could start making distributions “within the next few weeks.”

Bankrupt lender Voyager Digital could start distributing cash and crypto to creditors “within the next few weeks,” according to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the troubled crypto lender’s bankruptcy case.

The firm is finalizing the liquidation procedures after crypto exchange Binance.US pulled out of a $1.3 billion deal to buy its assets.

“Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors,” the creditors committee said on Twitter. ""We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.

The court-approved restructuring plan had included a “toggle” that allowed Voyager to liquidate if Binance.US decided to exit the deal. The crypto exchange said it backed away from the plan due to the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” 

The failed deal between Voyager and Binance.US was met with government scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicated in a court hearing that staff believe Binance.US is operating an unregistered securities exchange in the country, although the commission hasn’t taken an official position.

Voyager bankruptcy asset recovery

Voyager must first file the liquidation procedures in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and parties will then have 10 days to object to the plan. The company said it had more than 100,000 creditors when it filed for bankruptcy protection last summer.

“If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go ‘effective’ with the plan at that time,” the committee said."" If an objection is filed, the Court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go effective.""

Of the 6% of creditors who voted on the proposed Voyager restructuring plan, 97% voted in favor. Customers would have seen a 73% recovery of assets under the Binance.US proposal, although that percentage could have dropped to 48% if claims from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sibling Alameda Research are eventually successful.

With Star Wars NFTs, Disney takes one step closer into the world of crypto.
The digital toys will cost $39.99.

With wannabe Jedis rattling their lightsabers around the world in honor of Thursday's Star Wars Day celebrations, Cryptoys has announced it will be selling — in partnership with Disney — digital toys fashioned after three of the movie franchises' most iconic characters.

Cryptoys, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Mattel and Dapper Labs, said it will release “15 limited-edition Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Darth Vader collectible digital toys.”

Although The Walt Disney Company is one of the most successful marketers and sellers of merchandise based on famous intellectual property, the Hollywood studio and theme park operator has yet to make a big foray into crypto.

Last year, the media conglomerate advertised a job opening for a transaction lawyer to explore emerging technology opportunities, according to a posting on LinkedIn.

Powered by Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, consumers can buy Cryptoys Star Wars NFTs for $39.99. Purchases will be possible with Apple  Pay and Google Pay, “worldwide,” according to the company.

"Biden wants 'to get rid of crypto,' Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warns","May 4, 2023, 12:50PM EDT ","Biden wants 'to get rid of crypto,' Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warns

QUICK TAKE
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who’s a possible presidential candidate in next year’s election, alleged there were people that ‘want to get rid of crypto.’
DeSantis said this week that legislation to ban central bank digital currencies in the state is advancing.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the Sunshine state would soon move against any kind of a central bank digital currency, with lawmakers advancing with legislation that could be on his desk within ""the next couple of weeks.""

""Florida rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on May 2. ""You could just get fined, and they'll just take it right out of your digital currency, without any due process or anything like that. And so it gives the government a huge amount of power over your economic self sufficiency and independence.""

The Republican is an avid critic of centrally controlled digital currencies, but he's expressed support in the past for decentralized cryptocurrencies because the government has no control over them.

DeSantis, who's widely considered as a possible presidential candidate in next year's election, has previously accused President Joe Biden of eyeing the technology for “surveillance and control.” He first announced the legislation that would outlaw centralized digital currencies in the state in March. 

His Tuesday comments came amid widespread discussion of what's been perceived by some to be a broad crackdown on the crypto sector by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase, a U.S.-listed crypto exchange, is suing the regulator and calling for clear rules.  

Crypto crackdown

""They want to get rid of crypto,"" DeSantis said. ""They don't like crypto because they can't control crypto, so they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency.""

""My view is is like, if you want to invest in crypto, it's up to you,"" DeSantis continued. ""You can do it. I mean, like, you can make those decisions.""

DeSantis' press office said in an emailed response to questions that he was referring to ""those such as the Biden Administration."" In the Tuesday remarks, the governor said an agenda was being imposed by an ""elite"" with access to ""to a lot of financial might, a lot of business resources, corporate resources.""

DeSantis said the pending legislation in Florida would provide preemptive protection from a U.S. central bank digital currency, even though one doesn't yet exist.  

DeSantis warns against 'financial surveillance state'

""I don't think Congress would authorize it,"" DeSantis said. ""But if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally, in Florida, we'll have a prohibition against that. And I think that that's ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don't have a financial surveillance state, where they know every transaction that you're making.""

DeSantis first raised his opposition to centralized digital currencies last year, but he has previously taken a friendlier approach toward decentralized tokens and has said he was working on ways for Floridians to pay taxes with crypto.

The Biden administration has developed policy objectives for a possible CBDC system in the U.S., with the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department both conducting research in the area.
